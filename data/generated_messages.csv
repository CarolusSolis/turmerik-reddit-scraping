TheIdealHominidae,"Hi,

Many of you suffer from the lack of diagnosis and sometimes the lack of trust from doctors or family/friends or even yourself, as to wether you really have a disease, or wether you are ""faking it"" or simply psychosomatic (an actual medical condition).

The reason for this difficulty, is that many chronic illnesses symptoms are rather unspecific, even more so at the early stages (e.g. in the case of autoimmunity), such as unlocalized pain, tiredness, etc.

I have studied the topic of cytotoxicity which is an almost universal common component of diseases and its biomarkers.

We have routine biomarkers that often allows to almost localize and or rule out entire organs, for example transaminases (and a few others) for the liver, lipase/amylase/glucose for the pancreas, creatinine for the kidney, creatine kinase for muscles and the heart, etc

While those biomarkers are excellent for the above reasons, when they shows up negative there still remains a very large list of systemic diseases.

Diseases are characterized by inflammation unfortunately CRP and ESR only shows up in a minority of inflammatory conditions.

There is another widely available biomarker, LDH, that by design quantify in a non organ selective way, the amount of cell death (because LDH is contained in every cells and is not normally present in much quantities in blood unless it leaks from dying cells)

So it is one of the closest thing we have that approximate an universal marker of inflammation and therefore of diseases. In light of this understanding, it has recently been tested on 48 diseases and found to shows up as elevated in 46 of the 48 diseases, which is impressive.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8217520/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8217520/)

The normal range is up to 153 u/L but in many conditions it is only slighly elevated in the 150s-170s a result that is often ignored despite being indicative of disease activity.

LDH serves three key purposes, 1) to observe that there is a disease activity/cytotoxicity 2) to quantify the extent of the systemic toxicity 3) to assess the effect of medications and supplements on cytotoxicity by observing or not an LDH reduction post treatment, consistently.

While LDH is not truly universal and there are many diseases where it will *not* shows up, it still is according to this study the most broad biomarker of the presence of a disease.

And in my opinion its use (complement and does not replace other biomarkers) for assessing 2) and 3) is underatted, being a direct marker of the quantity of cells death.

It is important to note that LDH is largely useless to actually diagnose *which* disease you have (unless it is extremely high) and this probably is why it is sadly underused in practice.

There are other markers that are even more universal than LDH, the markers of oxidative stress (such as malondialdehyde levels) however unfortunately those markers are a bit expensive contrary to LDH.

While I'm at it, some specific biomarkers I consider are underused:

For neurodegenerative diseases, there is a recently developped, universal marker of brain neurons/axons damage. The neurofilament light chain in CSF.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10380627/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10380627/)

It unfortunately is not available everywhere and it probably costly. Moreover while it assess for neurotoxicity and is useful for point 2) and 3), as for LDH, it usually does not allows a specific diagnosis, still their uses outlined are very useful and their broadeness in scope makes them particularly fit for people that fails to be diagnosed.

Another broad biomarker are free light chains in blood, the name is similar but their use is radically different. Except for a few conditions like amyloidosis, free light chains does not allows a specific diagnosis, however there are papers showing it often is elevated in many (most?) autoimmune diseases

such as: Rheumatoid arthritis, sjogren

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16569685/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16569685/)

lupus

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21312346/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21312346/)

etc

As for LDH, they do not allows a diagnosis, however they allows to quantify 2) disease activity and 3) the effect of medication(s)/supplements.

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24099109/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24099109/)

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21221683/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21221683/)

Free lights chains are not proven to be an universal marker of autoimmunity but it stills is the most proven biomarker to shows up in different autoimmune diseases.

Those recents scientific discoveries about correlates of old biomarkers, are in my opinion a scientific revolution for the clinical practice of chronic illnesses.

As said, while those markers won't always shows up they are the most broad ones available, they are widely available (except neurofilament), and hence is a major tool to help undiagnosed people to be considered and further investigated despite not allowing diagnosis.

Moreover the ability to monitor disease severity and to partially (doesn't replace other biomarkers and methods) quantify the reduction in disease cytotoxicity by therapeutics is an essential tool of precision medicine that can improve the quality of life and prognosises of patients and allows for fast, empirical trial and error of different therapeutics instead of blindly believing the current therapeutic combination is empirically the optimal one (maximal reduction).","Subject: Invitation to Join the Chronic Pain Management Study at Medical Research Institute

Sonaak_Kroinlah,"This is my second time seeing her and both times she's been really nice, actually listened to me, seemed to understand what I'm talking about and how my existing diagnoses might affect things, and been willing to run test/trial medications and just generally help me get answers. She said to come back if it's not working! Not just ""idk I can't help you""! When I asked for a specific test that she didn't think could show anything, I explained the study I'd read to the contrary and she agreed to ask the lab to run it instead of doubling down and calling me a dr google idiot! Can you believe it?! 

I actually come away from my appointments with her feeling heard and hopeful instead of insulted and upset.

potsandmm," My name is Bryn and I am a Clinical Research Coordinator at Massachusetts General Hospital.  I am looking for volunteers in New England to enroll for a clinical trial to investigate how medical cannabis can affect opioid use and pain. The goal of this study is to see whether medical cannabis might help people reduce their dose of opioid medications, while receiving support from clinicians to manage pain.

 Participants will receive up to $1,130 in payments, which are made monthly following the completion of each study visit. We are looking for people who:

1. Are 18-75 years old
2. Use prescription opioids for chronic pain
3. Do not regularly use cannabis
4. Are located in New England

The study will involve 3 components:

1. A weekly Prescription Opioid Taper Support (POTS) group, where you will work with trained clinicians to learn pain management skills and create an individualized opioid reduction plan to match your goals. Groups meet weekly for 26 weeks over Zoom.
2. Daily surveys, where you will be asked to complete a short (1-2 minute) survey on your phone each day to help keep track of your pain levels, medications, and health.
3. 8 study visits, which are completed over 6 months, and can be done in person or via Zoom. Day and evening appointments are available.

 Many people think that medical cannabis may help with pain management or opioid medication reduction. This trial will help determine whether medical cannabis is helpful or not in patients with chronic pain on prescription opioids.

iusedtoski,"I don't have a recommendation for a pain md in that area, I'm sorry.

A couple of things:

First, I'm recently finding that it seems there are specialists in pelvic pain and they might reside in urogynecology, not in standard pain mgmt practices.  These people aren't even that well known to the pain management clinics I've tried.  These clinics will say ""pelvic floor therapy?"" or ""have you talked to your gynecologist"" and maybe if that person is a PCP they might not know about this specialty either ... so I figured I'd mention it.

I could see that maybe a pain mgmt practice could have one of those specialists on staff. However, in my experience (5 clinics so far maybe?), pain mgmt practitioners that one might encounter in a hospital's ""pain clinic"" seem to have only spotty knowledge of this area.  The ones I've met have been more coming from a background of general anesthesiology or neurology, and seem to be most solid in the areas of arthritis / spine / limb neuropathy / CRPS and stuff like that.  Anything to do with the specifics of the uro or the genitals and a lot of them are somewhat lost.

Second, as it happens, I met with a urogynecology pelvic pain MD today in my area, and I mentioned the TENS treatment for neurogenic (spasming) bladder.  She knew of it.  I've been using it to relax muscles in my deep gluteal but it's used for bladder, and for spasming in other areas.  All these areas are served by nerves that come from the sacral plexus, which is apparently why it works for all of them.

I just looked it up and it seems to be a treatment for IC, too.  Here are a couple of links showing at least some promising results.  I've read other links that give much higher response rates for some issues for structures served by these nerves, I mean above 75% success.  \[edit: and it might be possible that it's that successful for IC, too.  There is some indication that anecdotal reports are stronger than what research has been able to pin down\].  And of course the TENS electrodes are totally non-invasive.  As long as one doesn't have a syndrome that rules out their use, like fibrillation or epilepsy, of course.  But I use mine on and off throughout the day and even to fall asleep, and I have seen research showing that that's fine too.

Old-Goat,"You really gotta find some insurance. Just a single test can pay for the yearly premium. Its not so much for the doctor, but all that other stuff that comes with a medical issue. Healthcare.gov is no help? Sometimes a hospital will have a free health fair, you may want to try those, too. Dont make the mistake of using the ER to figure this out, those docs are not trained to treat the kind of health issue you describe. Unless you have a recent gunshot wound, the ER isnt going to be much help.

Are you familiar with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome? Its a collection of hyperflexibility conditions. Lots of subluxing, lots of dislocations. I dont think there's much they can do for the hyperflexibilty issue other than strengthening and conditioning the connective tissues, which in turn can cause subluxing and dislocations, so you need to be careful doing it.

A lot of docs will work with you if your insurance doesnt cover them or if youre self pay. They will often cut you some slack on the billing if you talk to them.

Work is tough. Telemarketing/phone support is usually something you can do from home working your own hours. Try[these guys](https://www.ntiathome.org/) I'm pretty sure they have been around for quite a while.

One thing Id suggest looking in to on line is relaxation techniques. Pain patients live extremely stressful lives, even if theyre fully insured.  Deep breathing is usually a big part of it. You actually want to breathe from your belly, not your chest. Bringing in more 02 is actually a relaxant. Thats why one of the !st things they do is get a patient on oxygen. It makes them quiet. I dont know if you recall it, but Oxygen Bars were a big fad for a while. Grab a soda and huff a couple liters. But youre also making other metabolic changes, like reducing your adrenaline production. Thats real helpful, if youre trying to relax.  You are in a stressful situation, so it shouldnt be much of a surprise you feel the way you do. That does not mean you shouldnt do something about it if you can. Usually I tell folks to seek a pain psychologist, but the last thing you need is another medical bill, for now.

Hang in there. When you get discouraged by the medical system, take a look at what the folks in the UK are saying about free healthcare for all. That doesnt work either. Canada's hybrid insurance system seems to suck, too. I hear Cuba has good health care....","Subject: Invitation to Join Our Innovative Chronic Pain Management Study

spineissues2018,"It's been a rough patch with the neurosurgeons. (Fused cervical and Lumbar - scoliosis) After a team clinical review twice, they have decided against going with the T10 to Pelvis fusion. The value add for the invasiveness didnt match so we jointly agreed that it doesnt make sense. They feel that my kyphotic neck (reverse curve) is causing a large part of sagittal imbalance. I am falling frequently and have broke some teeth etc, shit is getting old and it hurts really bad because my body is in spasms from trying to correct the imbalance.  They would like to fix the neck surgically, but that will require them to re-break my neck to change the curve. After peer reviews with the team, the decision was to not do this due to the risk reward. They did confirm that my bilateral radiculopathy and bilateral Poly sensory neuropathy is nerve damage and there is no recourse other than implanting two hi frequency SCSs.  I am going to waiting and see on the SCSs. I did a trial on one unit a decade ago and it sucked. Not seeing a huge percentage of people saying they love it and it was worth the surgery and scar tissue to do it. Love to hear from others.

I went back to my PM Doc and mea culpa'd. He confirms on my recent MRI that I have Modic 2 level changes from T12 to S1. We're going to do the Intracept on L3 thru S1. I have read a lot of studies as well as feed back on the forums where a high percentage of recipients have had great results. I know this wont fix all the issues, but if I can knock down one of my pain generators a notch or two for a significant amount of time, I am game. Love to hear from others if their Intracept procedure has helped them long term. 

Thanks for listening to my vent, it's been a real rough patch these last 6 months. I am hoping to get some relief and maybe give some hope to others.  Happy day after fourth everyone.

Physical_Put8246,"Hi OP, I do not have any personal experience with the Intracept. However my mom had it done at L4, L5, S1 about 7 years ago. She had a fusion surgery 20 years ago. The surgery was helpful, but after 10 years her severe back pain returned. The Intracept was a lifesaver! It resolved 90% of her back pain. 

However, my Mom developed a neurogenic bladder and neuropathy in her feet and legs. *Her neurosurgeon and functional medicine doctor could not determine if she developed those issues from the Intracept procedure or something else.* She has had tons of studies, imaging and labs, but the etiology was never determined. My mom and I were discussing this recently. She said that she would have the Intracept procedure again.

NoMenuAtKarma,"Hi everybody, I've done as much research as I can and still haven't found the info that I need, so I'm hoping someone here has some experience with this.

My former pain clinic started me on sublingual buprenorphine (a generic for Subutex) last year and it works really well for me. I'm on 2mg every 8 hours, along with a short acting opiate, membrane stabilizer and muscle relaxer. Due to pressure to agree to interventional procedures that I'm not comfortable with (like a C1 laminectomy for a stimulator trial!!!), I opted to transfer care to a different practice. At the same time, I've started having issues with my teeth, so I asked the new provider about transdermal patches. She thought it was a good idea and prescribed what I thought was a 5mg patch, but is actually a 5 microgram/hour patch.  

My concern is that I'm transitioning from 6 milligrams per day to 12 micrograms (edit: 120 micrograms) per day, which is an enormous dose reduction. I've been trying to research absorption between sublingual and transdermal routes, but haven't found much data comparing the two as Subutex is primarily used for OUD, rather than pain management (I had no idea about this, unfortunately.) I found a comparison between Butrans and Temgesic, but the dosage for Temgesic is also very different than Subutex.

JJscience_computer,"I don’t know if this is a fact but, a 5mcg/hr patch should deliver an actual 5mcg per hour to the blood. (In other words you don’t need to factor n bioavailability I don’t THINK, it could be good to ask a pharmacist or doctor though).

Compared to SL buprenorphine which has a bioavailability of about 25% this would mean of that 6mg per day only 1.5mg is actually getting absorbed.

With that being said that’s still a 90% reduction in the dose, but at least it’s not as much as 6mg to 0.120mg.

I’ve also been on Subutex for many years. I went from 8mg to 2mg but I did it pretty slowly, over a year or so.

If I went to 2mg right away I would probably feel it though buprenorphine can be different than other opioids, sometimes you can reduce the dose by quite a lot and not feel anything until it gets very low.","Subject: Invitation to Join an Innovative Chronic Pain Management Study

Doensnow,"I've been taking Pregabalin at 150 mg 3x daily for over 2 years. I recently moved to a new state and during my initial evaluation at the new pain management clinic, they did the typical urine drug screen. But, it WAS sent out to a lab for confirmatory testing. 

My new PCP here is managing my Pregabalin, but I was interested in doing a spinal cord stimulator trial. So, I had my appointment and got a feeling for the clinic and see if it was a good fit. Ultimately, I decided to go back to Mayo as I just feel more comfortable there with any further procedure. Still, I contacted the pain clinic and let them know what I decided and completed a release to get my visit note. I'm disability for almost 10 years and learned to keep literally any medical note for any reason.  

Today I got my record along with results from the urine drug screen. It was an extensive screen - I mean every substance. I noticed that the Pregabalin was negative and so was every substance that was checked. However, the list didn't include Baclofen, which I'm also on and have been taking 10mg 3x daily for 5 years. 

Obviously my sample was sent to a lab due to reporting I take Pregabalin yet my screen and my lab came back negative. I've researched as much as I can but literally find no cases with a false negative unless the person wasn't taking the drug or otherwise tampered with the sample. Even a rapid metabolizer wouldn't show up negative when sent to an actual lab for that special testing they do for confirmation. I know the drug is in the capsules as it continues to manage my pain to some degree and if I miss a dose, the nerve pain is unreal and improves after taking it. Has this happened to anyone else here?

Top-Squirrel6107,"Greetings:
 
Shortages of opioids and other medications reached record levels in the first quarter of 2024, according to the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists. Opioid litigation and cuts in DEA production quotas appear to be responsible for some drug shortages.

PNN columnist Dr. Forest Tennant shares some of his recent findings about the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which appears to play a role in many cases of chronic and intractable pain.

Investigators in Australia found little evidence that spinal cord stimulators help treat chronic back pain. Some patients have more pain after getting the devices.

Got TMJ? People with chronic jaw pain often have surgery to reposition or even replace their jaws. The results are often disappointing.

In a small clinical trial, patients suffering from severe spinal cord injuries improved after injections of stem cells. One patient paralyzed from the neck down is even able walk again.

Have you visited our Suggested Reading page? I recently added new books on the health effects of toxic stress and how older women can live better, age better, and get better medical treatment.

Thanks for reading and sharing.

Aavaox,"Update: I got butt hole botox! lol it’s fun to say. I also found a medication that’s commonly used for lower pelvic muscle relaxation called Flexril, and it has dramatically improved my quality of life. Turns out I have a condition called EoE, but it seems to affect my entire digestive system. It’s a low grade allergic reaction that’s constant. It lines the digestive tract with eosinophils which are allergy cells, which make the channels of the tract more and more constricted with exposure to the allergens. I can still only eat very little foods, but a very hard elimination diet has helped, along with weekly shots to help with the inflammation. The flexril helps to relax the muscles in addition to only eating safe foods. I landed myself in the hospital and nearly died from malnutrition and that’s what started this whole fiasco. In addition to a blood clot in my groin which potentially lowered the blood flow to the area, causing more swelling. Bowel movements still cause some pain, but it’s more of a 3-4 instead of a 9/10. I can walk around and am generally more independent now. I’m off the narcotic pain meds, and I can work now. Looking back on this post makes me wanna hug my former self. She had no hope. I wanna thank everyone who commented with solutions and support. It greatly helped me at the time and still means the world. Thanks for everything, and I hope those who still struggle can find hope that with time it WILL get better if you don’t give up.
Fr guys, check out flexril, the positive effects have been incredibly helpful through this, and it’s a common medication we missed out of all the meds we tried for pelvic pain. 


TLDR: life is ruined by chronic butthole pain 
I’m sorry this is a long one, partially a cry sesh, and a call to not be so alone. Even if you can’t relate, I think I just need some kind of emotional support. The pain I have is literally constant, there is no way to relief other than to sleep, and I can’t sleep until exhaustion because of the pain. It’s so overstimulating, I’m bedridden, my days are the same, I’m on psych meds AND in therapy and im at that point I know you all know so well when you’re not sure if it’s worth being alive for this quality of life

I have a GI complication from a bowel resection performed hours after birth, which has caused me 23 years of chronic diarrhea. I’ve shit minimum 6 times a day basically my whole life. I’ve spent any time not shitting, strongly clenching my Spincter muscles unconsciously in order to not shit myself while living daily life. Over time, my Spincter muscles have become hypertonic. Theyre just permanently tensed. I’ve also had some sexual trauma in that area which has created this psychological connection to some of the muscle clenching as well. 
Almost 3 years ago I started having random rectal pain. Like when you get your period and you get those electric shocks but mine would last SO long. Over time they became more and more frequent and last longer. I’d go to the ER because they’d last for an hour or two, it being associated with bowel movements. Having a doctor perform a digital exam forcing the muscles open was honestly traumatic. Pooping was painful before and especially after because of the spasms. it would feel like there was a ball in my anal canal. I’m talking 9/10 throwing up on the toilet screaming out loud suffering. I’d have to sit in a hot shower or a burning sitz bath for relief. 9 months into this whole fiasco,  every time I had a bowel movement, I would have to lay down for 2 hours and mentally distract myself until the pain would go down to tolerable level and then I could stand. Occasionally I’d have a GI flare up and spend the entire day at a 9/10 pain, stuck between shitting, laying in bed and laying in a burning hot bath just crying. After 2 years of seeing a primary, seeing GI, having all of the tests done, being hospitalized multiple times, misdiagnosed with nerve pain, fibromyalgia, “it’s just your trauma and ptsd”, so SO many different psych medications with all their dangerous side effects, psychotherapy the entire time, meanwhile the situation gets progressively worse. Finally my GI sits me down and says “there’s nothing clinically wrong with your rectum. So the best I can do is prescribe psychical therapy and psychotherapy, the obvious answer is PTSD.” 

I spend 4 months with a pelvic PT doing vaginal muscle releases and exercises that don’t seem to be helping anything at all.
 Comming up on year 3. I don’t leave my house, I eat the exact same super healthy organic diet (less than 10 ingredients, no unhealthy comfort foods), I do my PT exercises, I take all my medications as prescribed, and I spend my near every waking thought thinking about the pain, how to avoid the pain, when it will be the worst, dreading every single bowel movement, the pelvic spasms come at all hours of the day, my Spincter muscle is so tight event a fart hurts 7/10. 
I can’t sit up right. Standing hurts, sitting hurts, laying on my side hurts the least. 
Last week my PT told me I have Levator ani syndrome which is a chronically hypertonic pelvic floor. 
My pelvic floor muscles don’t relax fully, and my rectal muscles are permanently flexed as hard as possible. Mental stress is absolutely connected to it as well. (This I had already noticed) Pain meds don’t help, muscle relaxers don’t seem to help. Exercises don’t help, I have a good connection with my nervous system, and relaxing my nervous system doesn’t help, meditation doesn’t help, hot bath doesn’t help (it’s ritual at this point) diaphragmatic breathing doesn’t help, releasing trigger points seems to make it worse. 
With this syndrome treatment is pretty individual to the sufferers body, and it just takes time and trial and error to find what works. I’m relieved to finally know it has a name and get started on the journey of finding what works for me, but right now i feel so unbelievably alone. Levator ani sydrome has robbed me of so many things, it affects every aspect of my life and no one even knows what it is.

Now I am curious about clinical research (trials, being a PI, learning to run trials etc). Assuming that a starting career in clinical research as a PI pays the same, what’s the key difference in lifestyle? What about career growth? Interoperability between research and clinician?

I was assuming that as a physician clinical knowledge is pretty important if you wanted to keep practicing, but if you switch to a research job and never did any true clinical practice are you basically locking yourself out of the clinical aspect? Would it be much more difficult to get back to clinical practice if you were never truly an attending, versus going into research later say 3-5 years? 

Wanted to hear some thoughts on this topic ","Subject: Invitation to Join Our Innovative Chronic Pain Management Study

finnoulafire,"I am not a physician but work in clinical research and have worked with a number of experienced and novice Principal Investigators on the conduct of trials.

Based on where you are at in terms of knowledge of clinical trial operations, if you are interested in working in clinical research as a site investigator:

* I STRONGLY recommend finding a group practice or hospital setting with an established clinical research program in your setting. Eg, the group has at least 2 or 3 clinical research coordinators working on 6-10 clinical trials; the trials include some interventional trials (not just observational or bio-banking); the trials include some industry sponsored / FDA regulated trials (not just Investigator initiated or academic grant funded)

* I STRONGLY recommend finding a mentor who currently operates at least 2-3 industry sponsored clinical trials in your practice area

* I STRONGLY recommend starting out by working with that mentor as a 'sub-investigator' on a couple of their trials

* Expect that it will take 2 or 3 years of gradually assuming additional responsibilities on trials before you are really 'ready' to lead a trial as a Principal Investigator. This is primarily due to the fact that most clinical trials have long life-cycles, and gaining experience requires work during the start up, implementation, subject recruitment, subject follow-up, and trial closure phases of a trial.

* Some small Sponsors may be willing to work with you as a Principal Investigator without much prior experience. Unless you have a robust team of investigators and clinical research nurses / coordinators around you, this is not recommended. 

About half of physicians who attempt to become Principal Investigators in industry sponsored trials quit after **one trial** [see this article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S245186541630093X)

This is because until a novice physician works on their first trial, they really do not understand the workload involved. They do not understand that the bar is higher than routine clinical practice. It's better for everyone if you understand what you're signing up for before you get in over your head.","Subject: Invitation to Join Our Innovative Chronic Pain Management Study

Calavar,"Bigthama already raises some great points. Adding on:

> Hello all, out of residency and setting up my job... Assuming that a starting career in clinical research as a PI

As Bigthama said, working towards PI is usually a path that people start in medical school and continue through residency (and fellowship, if applicable). If you're on this path, you should have already checked off some boxes by the time you are out of training:

* You went to a residency (or fellowship) program that was heavily research oriented, published a few first author papers, and made some connections within your specialty's academic community
* You prepared K grant applications before you completed residency (or fellowship). Hopefully you already have a grant in hand.
* Your first job is an academic job with protected research time. Preferably something in the realm of 80% research time

If you haven't checked these boxes, you can't easily segue into being a PI. You would have to go back to training and complete a fellowship with a heavy research focus.

> Assuming that a starting career in clinical research as a PI pays the same

It doesn't. This is the first thing to be aware of. There is less money in research. Maybe a lot less, depending on how well your clinical specialty is reimbursed.

> If you switch to a research job and never did any true clinical practice are you basically locking yourself out of the clinical aspect

No, you are not locking yourself out. Generally it's much, much easier to move from research to clinical practice than it is to move in the opposite direction.

There are some caveats: If you completed a research heavy residency/fellowship, that usually involves sacrificing clinical time to fit in more research time, and for procedural specialties that can mean that your case numbers drop. This won't lock you out of clinical practice by any means, but it might make you less versatile as a proceduralist.

> what’s the key difference in lifestyle

It's a matter of perspective, and it really depends on your specialty and your personality. Research comes with the headache of a perpetual funding rat race and a constant grey cloud of uncertainty (what happens if you don't get the next grant). That's really stressful. On the other hand, it's a very different stress than loads of call and showing up at the hospital to handle 3 AM emergencies. If your specialty is heavy on that sort of thing, reducing your clinical hours and call to add research/admin time might be a lifestyle friendly move.","Subject: Invitation to Participate in the Chronic Pain Management Study

I saw a relatively recent [letter](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8343642/) from 2021 that believes there is sufficient clinical evidence for their use in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. 

Beyond that, the literature is cold; admittedly, this is after just a cursory search. There are other purported benefits for supplementation, but research is sparse or poor quality. 

If there is clarity on the horizon, even in improved studies or guidelines and recommendations (beyond hypertriglyceridemia), does anyone have the word on what it will be?

I once had a patient with elevated LDL-C and a whopping 700 triglycerides which also increases risk for pancreatitis. A combination of Rosuvastatin + Fenofibrate has the least adverse effects so I prescribed that patient with a Rosuvastatin 20mg + Fenofibrate 160 mg combination pill plus a recommendation of increased physical activity and decreased intake of red meat. 

One question raised by my patient is if it’s okay for her to continue taking fish oil supplements. I said no because common fish oil supplements contain both DHA and EPA.

pillywill,"I work at an anticoag clinic and have a patient on Xarelto 15 mg daily for a. Fib based off of CrCl 48 ml/min. Scr is a stable 1.0-1.1 over the course of two years. Weight has declined from 130 lb to 124 lb over past two years. Age is nearing 80 y/o. We know CrCl is only going to decline further unless there's a big gain in weight.

Cardiology increased dose to 20 mg due to increased incidences of a. Fib (per patient). Left a message to clarify with them, but wanted to hear what r/medicine thinks. 

I, like I imagine many others, would much rather patient be on eliquis. Apparently they had a rash when they took if before but they could not confirm if it was eliquis or something else. They would be willing to switch if needed. Would like to stick with Xarelto if possible for dosing convenience though.

**This is an outpatient setting. My decision is either continue at Xarelto 15 mg or trial eliquis.

forlornucopia,"TL;DR version - does negative electric charge at wound site actually aid healing? If so, are wound care clinics actually using this method?

I was recently reading a book of short stories and essays about various things, mostly sort of fringe science/paranormal stuff that would typically be considered ""mumbo jumbo"" (the book was recommended to me by a friend, i wouldn't have picked it out to read on my own, but i find myself to be entertained and intrigued by it). But then i read this paragraph about a scientist in the 1970s who successfully got amputated animal limbs to grow back with use of a negative electric current. The author doesn't cite any sources for all the grandiose claims so at first i was like ""no way, this is too big a claim"", i.e. ""proof or it didn't happen!""

So then my curiosity was piqued. I did a quick google search for studies about negative electric currents and limb regrowth and wound healing. And darn it if this hasn't actually been shown to be true in randomized trials. Of course, the author sensationalized for dramatic effect, but it seems that wounds tend to have a negative charge about them when healing, and if you apply a negative charge from outside it seems to make wounds heal faster. No studies have yet shown a negative charge to help a mammal regrow a lost limb, but there have been studies showing that mice with amputated limbs could be induced to ""sort of start"" to regrow a lost limb, i.e. some additional bone and other tissue growth at a nub but without actual limb regrowth.

What i'm really surprised about is that this seems to be well established scientific knowledge, that we have known about since the 1970s or earlier. But i don't remember hearing anything about it in medical school, and of all the patients i've referred to Wound Care, none of them ever had batteries attached to their chronic wounds as far as i know. So why not? Is it that it doesn't really work as well as the studies suggest, or that people aren't aware of the effects, or that there's some severe side effect or something?

Bearacolypse,"This is a PT wound care thing since it uses would healing modalities (Estim). That's where you will find the most research. Since wound care PTs have been phased out of many health care systems there are not a lot of people using evidence based wound healing modalities nationwide.


PT wound focuses on interventions vs nursing wound care which mostly focuses on dressing changes. 

Reimbursement dropped suddenly about 10-15 years ago for these procedures. To the point where 15 minutes of Estim for wound care is like a $20 service and so most places stopped offering it. Even though the research supports it. Medicare don't care with their fee schedules. 

Same thing with compression, serial debridement, NPWT,  pulse lavage, ultrasound MIST, UV light treatment, maggot therapy, and iontophoresis. All of which are evidence based and have a significant impact of wound healing outcomes. 

Since these are all procedural the drop in reimbursement made the therapists who were doing it too expensive. 


I was lucky enough to work as a wound care PT in a level 1and got to do all of the above stuff. It was so cool and legit saved lives. I had to quit because they refused to pay us more than $36/hour and my loans are too much for that salary. 

Our wound center had 3 wound docs who were super limited in what they could offer outpatient because of reimbursement. They would actually admit people for us to see because it was easier to get insurance to cover wound vacs and debridement that way.

Edit: forgot to elmention that in some states WOCRNs may do similar treatments but I've never seen a WOCRNs who had extensive education on modalities. Most are okay with wound vacs and very iffy on the rest.","Subject: Invitation to Participate in the Chronic Pain Management Study

queue517,"Hi all, 

I'm a PhD and was asked to present at a conference in a session specifically meant for clinicians on a specific class of side effects following gene therapy. CME credit will be given for attending the lecture. I am confident in my knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of these side effects. However, I am not a physician, so while I can talk about what has happened in clinical trials when when these side effects occurred (what course of action the physicians took), my knowledge when it comes to tests and drugs is somewhat limited. I know the big ones that would apply, but that's about it.

I want my lecture to be helpful! I also have to turn my slides in ahead of time and have them approved by the medical school this session is sponsored by, so obviously want to make sure I do them correctly the first time. But I've been given no guidance and have no idea what CME lectures are normally like.  
I'm open to any and all suggestions you have for how to make this lecture helpful to you. My plan right now is to cover the different types of side effects that fall into this class that can occur, what the underlying mechanism is, how they may manifest in the clinic, and ways that other physicians have responded. Sort of ""case study"" style. Part of this is going to involve a bit of a dive into molecular mechanisms of immune responses, which I know can make some people's eyes roll back in their head.

NoFlyingMonkeys,"Certification is attached to some of these orphan medications, has been for years. There is usually a short online course set up.

It's my impression that these certifications have been developed for 2 reasons:

* FDA requires that newly certified orphan drugs still be closely monitored for 1) serious side effects and 2) proof of continued efficacy, and the drug company is including us providers in the loop. So, the company is trying to standardize it across all providers with the training course, and yes you are helping them do it.
* Insurance:  a secondary goal of this is probably for the drug companies to convince insurance companies that yes these high $ meds are still showing benefit since FDA approval.

I guess I've always done the certifications just to stay in good graces with the orphan drug companies. Their patient coordinator reps help us with the insurance process (they provide justification letter templates for us to fill out, and help the patients with insurance on their end, get patients meds if uninsured, etc).","Subject: Invitation to Participate in the Chronic Pain Management Study

konqueror321,"I understand that insurance companies can cover or not cover specific treatments as they desire, and can create whatever series of hoop-jumps they feel is reasonable. Many insurance companies, and government health care providers (ie the VA) do this. I doubt that the overall concept can be fought.

I do have a question for OP however - I'm not a neurologist, and am long retired. From what I've read about the medicine in question it has 'statistically significant' improvement in function overall - but is that improvement clinically significant, and does it justify the cost of $300k per year? The articles and lectures (pdf slides posted on the internet) suggest that the mFAR generally declines 1-2 points per year in FA, and the info I've seen suggests a 'placebo adjusted' improvement of slightly over 2 points at about 1 year of use (on a scale of 0-100). And many subgroups of treated patients had error margins in the improvement data that crossed ""0"" ie were not statistically significant - for example patients over 18y old, females, and non-ambulatory patients did not have 'statistically significant' improvement.

maxkozlov,">A hairless, pale-skinned lamb lies on its side in what appears to be an oversized sandwich bag filled with hazy fluid. Its eyes are closed, and its snout and limbs jerk as if the animal — which is only about three-quarters of the way through its gestation period — is dreaming.  
>  
>The lamb was one of eight in a 2017 artificial-womb experiment carried out by researchers at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) in Pennsylvania. When the team published its research in April of that year, it released a video of the experiments that spread widely and captured imaginations — for some, evoking science-fiction fantasies of humans being conceived and grown entirely in a laboratory.  
>  
>Now, the researchers at CHOP are seeking approval for the first human clinical trials of the device they’ve been testing, named the Extra-uterine Environment for Newborn Development, or EXTEND. The team has emphasized that the technology is not intended — or able — to support development from conception to birth. Instead, the scientists hope that simulating some elements of a natural womb will increase survival and improve outcomes for extremely premature babies. In humans, that’s anything earlier than 28 weeks of gestation — less than 70% of the way to full term, which is typically between 37 and 40 weeks.  
>  
>The CHOP group has made bold predictions about the technology’s potential. In another 2017 video describing the project, Alan Flake, a fetal surgeon at CHOP who has been leading the effort, said: “If it’s as successful as we think it can be, ultimately, the majority of pregnancies that are predicted at-risk for extreme prematurity would be delivered early onto our system rather than being delivered premature onto a ventilator.” In 2019, several members of the CHOP team joined a start-up company, Vitara Biomedical in Philadelphia, which has since raised US$100 million to develop EXTEND.

I'm the reporter who wrote the story. I'd love to hear your thoughts as you read the story.

HHMJanitor,"Important to know that remission is the key goal in treating a depressive episode because a response alone is very likely to result in a relapse. While psilocybin separated from placebo for a response, it did not do so for remission. For comparison, pretty much every standard oral anti-depressant separates from placebo when looking at remission (https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(17)32802-7/fulltext#sec1). It's apples to oranges as far as study design, but a single dose of psilocybin seems to not meet the important threshold in actually preventing relapse (i.e. remission). Also important to note this study is not looking at the far more common psychedelic-assisted therapy. 

Also, it's really important for people not familiar with this to actually look at the exclusion criteria for psychedelics in these studies. In people with seemingly no significant risk factors these substances seem fairly benign, but the studies exclude a lot of people to get to that population.","Subject: Invitation to Join Our Innovative Chronic Pain Management Study

Divrsdoitdepr,"I was a PI for Phase 3 and 4 clinical trials. The regulatory experience was part of the reason I have the pharma position I have now.

Positives:
Some trials have substantial positive and immediate impact on subjects which is so great to witness.
International travel for PI meetings were always fun. Always extended and made a holiday of it.
Networking is incredible in the contacts you make. As you advance you may be able to be a part of the committees that determine the protocols to be used for future studies and the debates are always inspiring to have and see in my opinion. Leading minds agreeing and not agreeing coming to a compromise.


Negatives:
Adverse events may arise that may make a patient regret agreeing to the study and for folks like me it's hard not to feel bad that it didn't help them.
Some CROs are great and some are awful. I withdrew our institution from a study because the communication was subpar and critical labs were delayed.
Sometimes things will be too adjusted to the minimum requirements for FDA approval rather than really getting into whether it is superior or just non inferior and sometimes that is disappointing because you want to know more.

toledozzz21,"When I started my Child and Adolescent Psychiatry training in the 2010s, the diagnosis and treatment of gender dysphoria were rapidly becoming controversial in the field. Doctors and nurses who had spent decades on inpatient adolescent units, usually seeing one gender dysphoric child every 4-5 years, now saw multiple transgender-identifying kids in every inpatient cohort. It was a rare patient list that did not include at least one teenager with pronouns not matching their sex.  
   
Viewpoints about this differed, with every student, resident, fellow, and attending having their own perspective. All of us wanted what was best for patients, and these discussions were always productive and collegial. While I am not naive about how heated this topic can be online, I have only ever had good experiences discussing it with my colleagues. Some of my attendings thought that this was merely a social fad, similar to Multiple Personality Disorder or other trendy diagnoses, like the rise in Tourette's and other tic disorders seen during the early pandemic and widely attributed to social media. Others, including myself early on, thought we were merely seeing psychological education doing what it is supposed to do: patients who would, in earlier decades, not realize they were transgender until middle age were now gaining better psychological insight during their teen years. This was due to a combination of increased tolerance and awareness of transgender people and was a positive good that shouldn't necessarily raise any red flags or undue skepticism.  
   
During my outpatient fellowship year, I began to suspect a combination of both theories could be true, similar to ADHD or autism, where increasing rates of diagnosis likely reflected some combination of better cultural awareness (good) and confirmation bias leading to dubious diagnoses (bad). Confirmation bias is always a problem in psychiatric diagnosis, because almost all psychiatric diagnoses describe symptoms that exist along a spectrum, so almost anyone could meet the DSM5TR criteria for any condition, so long as you ignored the severity of the symptom, and people are often not good at judging the severity of their own symptoms, as they do not know what is ""normal"" in the broader population.  
   
I considered myself moderate on these issues. Every field of medicine faces a tradeoff between overtreatment and undertreatment, and I shared the worries of some of my more trans-affirming colleagues that many of these kids were at high risk for suicide if not given the treatment they wanted. Even if you attribute the increase in trans-identification among teens to merely a social fad, it was a social fad with real dangers. If an influencer or spiritual guru on social media was convincing teens that evil spirits could reside in their left ring finger, and they needed to amputate this finger or consider suicide, the ethical argument could be made that providing these finger amputations was a medically appropriate trade of morbidity for mortality. ""How many regretted hormonal treatments, breast surgeries, or (in our hypothetical) lost ring fingers are worth one life saved from suicide?"" is a reasonable question, even if you are skeptical of the underlying diagnosis.  
   
And I was always skeptical of the legitimacy of most teenagers' claims to be transgender, if for no other reason than because gender dysphoria was historically a rare diagnosis, and the symptoms they described could be better explained by other diagnoses. As the old medical proverb says, ""when you hear hoofbeats, think horses and not zebras."" The DSM5 estimated the prevalence of gender dysphoria in males as a range from 0.005% to 0.014%, and in females as a range of 0.002% to 0.003%, although the newer DSM5TR rightly notes the methodological limitations of such estimates.  
   
Regardless, most of the symptoms these teens described could be explained as identity disturbance (as in borderline personality disorder and some trauma responses), social relationship problems (perhaps due to being on the autism spectrum), body image problems (similar to and sometimes comorbid with eating disorders), rigid thinking about gender roles (perhaps due to OCD or autism), unspecified depression and anxiety, or just gender nonconforming behavior that fell within the normal range of human variation. It seems highly implausible that the entire field of psychiatry had overlooked or missed such high rates of gender dysphoria for so long. Some of my colleagues tried to explain this as being due to the stigma of being transgender, but I do not think it is historically accurate to say that psychiatry as a field has been particularly prudish or hesitant to discuss sex and gender. In 1909 Sigmund Freud published a case report about ""Little Hans,"" which postulated that a 5-year-old boy was secretly fixated on horse penis because of the size of the organ. I do not find it plausible that the next century of psychoanalysis somehow underestimated the true rate of gender dysphoria by multiple orders of magnitude because they were squeamish about the topic. In fact, the concept that young girls secretly wanted a penis was so well known that the term ""penis envy"" entered common English vocabulary! Of course, the psychoanalytic concept of penis envy is not gender dysphoria per se, but it is adjacent enough to demonstrate the implausibility of the notion that generations of psychoanalysts downplayed or ignored the true rate of gender dysphoria due to personal bigotry or cultural taboo.  
   
Therefore, for most of my career I have been in the odd position of doubting my gender-affirming colleagues, who would say ""trans kids know who they are"" and talk about saving lives from suicide, but also believing that they were making the best of a difficult situation. In the absence of any hard outcome data, all we had to argue about was theory and priors. I routinely saw adverse outcomes from these treatments, both people who regretted transitioning and those whose dysphoria and depression kept getting worse the more they altered their bodies, but I had to admit this might be selection bias, as presumably the success cases didn't go on to see other psychiatrists. I could be privately skeptical, but without any hard data there was no public argument to make. The gender affirming clinicians claimed that they could correctly identify which kinds of gender dysphoria required aggressive treatment (from DSMIV-TR to DSM5 the diagnosis was changed to emphasize and require identification with the opposite gender, rather than other kinds of gendered distress and nonconformity), and even when they were wrong they were appropriately trading a risk of long term morbidity for short term mortality. There was nothing to be done except wait for the eventual long term outcomes data.  
   
The waiting ended when I read the paper ""Psychosocial Functioning in Transgender Youth after 2 Years of Hormones"" by Chen et al in the NEJM. This is the second major study of gender affirming hormones (GAH) in modern pediatric populations, after Tordoff 2022, and it concluded ""GAH improved appearance congruence and psychosocial functioning."" The authors report the outcomes as positive: ""appearance congruence, positive affect, and life satisfaction increased, and depression and anxiety symptoms decreased."" To a first approximation, this study would seem to support gender affirming care. Some other writers have criticized the unwarranted causal language of the conclusion, as there was no control group and so it would have been more accurate to say ""GAH was associated with improvements"" rather than ""GAH improved,"" but this is a secondary issue.  
   
The problem with Chen 2023 isn't its methodological limitations. The problem is its methodological strength. Properly interpreted, it is a negative study of outcomes for youth gender medicine, and its methodology is reasonably strong for this purpose (most of the limitations tilt in favor of a positive finding, not a negative one). Despite the authors' conclusions, an in-depth look at the data they collected reveals this as a failed trial. The authors gave 315 teenagers cross-sex hormones, with lifelong implications for reproductive and sexual health, and by their own outcome measures there was no evidence of meaningful clinical benefit.  
   
315 subjects, ages 12-20, were observed for 2 years, completing 5 scales (one each for appearance, depression, and anxiety, and then two components of an NIH battery for positive affect and life satisfaction) every 6 months including at baseline. The participants were recruited at 4 academic sites as part of the Trans Youth Care in United States (TYCUS) study. Despite the paper's abstract claiming positive results, with no exceptions mentioned, the paper itself admits that life satisfaction, anxiety and depression scores did not improve in male-to-female cases. The authors suggest this may be due to the physical appearance of transwomen, writing ""estrogen mediated phenotypic changes can take between 2 and 5 years to reach their maximum effect,"" but this is in tension with the data they just presented, showing that the male-to-female cases improved in appearance congruence significantly. The rating scale they used is reported as an average of a Likert scale (1 for strong disagreement, 3 for neutral, and 5 for strong agreement) for statements like ""My physical body represents my gender identity"" and so a change from 3 (neutral) to 4 (positive) is a large effect.  
   
If a change from 3 out of 5 to 4 out of 5 is not enough to change someone's anxiety and depression, this is problematic both because the final point on the scale may not make a difference and because it may not be achievable. Other studies using the Transgender Congruence Scale, such as Ascha 2022 (""Top Surgery and Chest Dysphoria Among Transmasculine and Nonbinary Adolescents and Young Adults"") show a score of only 3.72 for female-to-male patients 3 months after chest masculinization. (The authors report sums instead of averages, but it is trivial to convert the 33.50 given in Table 2 because we know TCS-AC has 9 items.) The paper that developed this scale, Kozee 2012, administered it to over 300 transgender adults and only 1 item (the first) had a mean over 3.  
   
These numbers raise the possibility that the male-to-female cases in Chen 2023 may already be at their point of maximal improvement on the TCS-AC scale. A 4/5 score for satisfaction with personal appearance may be the best we can hope for in any population. While non-trans people score a 4.89 on this scale (according to Iliadis 2020), that doesn't mean that a similar score is realistically possible for trans people. When a trans person responds to this scale, they are essentially reporting their satisfaction with their appearance, while a non-trans person is answering questions about a construct (gender identity) they probably don't care about, which means you can't make an apples-to-apples comparison of the scores. If this is counter-intuitive to you, consider that a polling question like ""Are you satisfied with your knowledge of Japanese?"" would result in near-perfect satisfaction scores for those in the general public who have no interest in Japanese (knowledge and desire are matched near zero), but lower scores in students of the Japanese language. Even the best student will probably never reach the 5/5 satisfaction-due-to-apathy of the non-student.  
   
I am frustrated by the authors' decision not to be candid about the negative male-to-female results in the abstract, which is all most people (including news reporters) will be able to read. I have seen gender distressed teenagers with their parents in the psychiatric ER, and many of them are high functioning enough to read and be aware of these studies. While some teens want to transition for personal reasons, regardless of the outcomes data, in much the same way that an Orthodox Jew might want to be circumcised regardless of health benefits, others are in distress and are looking for an evidence-based answer. In the spring of 2023, I had a male-to-female teen in my ER for suicidal ideation, and patient and mother both expressed hopefulness about recently started hormonal treatment, citing news coverage of the paper. This teen had complicated concerns about gender identity, but was explicitly starting hormones to treat depression, and it is unclear whether they would have wanted such treatment without news reporting on Chen 2023.  
   
Moving on to the general results, the authors quantify mental health outcomes as: ""positive affect \[had an\] annual increase on a 100-point scale \[of\] 0.80 points...life satisfaction \[had an\] annual increase on a 100-point scale \[of\] 2.32 points...We observed decreased scores for depression \[with an\] annual change on a 63-point scale \[of\] −1.27 points...and decreased \[anxiety scores\] annual change on a 100-point scale \[of\] −1.46 points...over a period of 2 years of GAH treatment."" These appear to be small effects, but interpreting quantitative results on mental health scales can be tricky, so I will not say that these results are necessarily too small to be clinically meaningful, but because there is no control group these results are small enough to raise concerns about whether GAH outperforms placebo. It is unfortunate that it is not always straightforward to compare depression treatments due to several scales being in common use, but we can see the power of the placebo effect in other clinical trials on depression. In the original clinical trials for Trintellix, a scale called MADRS was used for depression, which is scored out of 60 points, and most enrolled patients had an average depression score from 31-34. Placebo reduced this score by 10.8 to 14.5 points within 8 weeks (see Table 4, page 21 of FDA label). For Auvelity, another newer antidepressant, the placebo group's depression on the same scale fell from 33.2 to 21.1 after 6 weeks (see Figure 3 of page 21 of FDA label).  
   
I won't belabor the point, but anyone familiar with psychiatric research will be aware that placebo effects can be very large, and they occur across multiple diagnoses, including surprising ones like schizophrenia (see Figure 3 of the FDA label for Caplyta). I am genuinely surprised and confused by how minimal this cohort's response to treatment was. Early in my career I thought we were trading the risk of transition regret for great short-term benefit, and I was confused when I noticed how patients given GAH didn't seem to get better. This data confirms my experience is not a fluke. I could go in depth about their anxiety results, which on a hundred-point scale fell by less than 3 points after two years, but this would read nearly identically to the paragraph above.  
   
A more formal analysis of this paper might try to estimate the effects of psychotherapy and subtract them away from the reported benefits of GAH, and an even more sophisticated analysis might try to tease apart the benefits of testosterone for gender dysphoria per se from its more general impact on mood, but I think this is unnecessary given the very small effects reported and the placebo concerns documented above. Putting biological girls on testosterone is conceptually similar to giving men anabolic steroids, and I remain genuinely surprised that it wasn't more beneficial for their mood in the short term. Some men on high doses of male steroids are euphoric to the point of mania.  
   
But my biggest concerns with this paper are in the protocol. This paper was part of TYCUS, the Trans Youth Care in United States study, and the attached protocol document, containing original (2016) and revised (2021) versions explains that acute suicidality was an exclusion criterion for this study (see section 4.6.4). There were two deaths by suicide in this study, and 11 reports of suicidal ideation, out of 315 participants, and these patients showed no evidence of being suicidal when the study began. This raises the possibility of iatrogenic harm. It would be beneficial to have more data on the suicidality of this cohort, but the next problem is that the authors did not report this data, despite collecting it according to their protocol document.  
   
The 5 reported outcome measures in Chen 2023 are only a small fraction of the original data collected. The authors also assessed suicidality, Gender Dysphoria per se (not merely appearance congruence), body esteem and body image (two separate scales), service utilization, resiliency and other measures. This data is missing from the paper. I do not fully understand why the NEJM allowed such a selective reporting of the data, especially regarding the adverse suicide events. A Suicidal Ideation Scale with 8 questions was administered according to both the original and revised protocol. In a political climate where these kinds of treatments are increasingly viewed with hostility and new regulatory burdens, why would authors, who often make media appearances on this topic, hide positive results? It seems far more plausible that they are hiding evidence of harm.  
   
Of course, Chen 2023 is not the only paper ever published on gender medicine, but aside from Tordoff 2022 it is nearly the only paper in modern teens to attempt to measure mental health outcomes. The Ascha 2022 paper on chest masculinization surgery I mentioned above uses as its primary outcome a rating scale called the Chest Dysphoria Measure (CDM), a scale that almost any person without breasts would have a low score on (with the possible exception of the rare woman who specifically wants to have prominent and large breasts that others will notice and comment on in non-sexual contexts), even if they experienced no mental health benefits from the breast removal surgery and regretted it. Only the first item (""I like looking at my chest in the mirror"") measures personal satisfaction. Other items, such as ""Physical intimacy/sexual activity is difficult because of my chest"" may be able to detect harm in a patient who strongly regrets the surgery but is worded in such a way as not to detect actual benefit. They should have left it at ""Physical intimacy/sexual activity is difficult"" because a person without breasts can't experience dysphoria or functional impairment as a result of having breasts, even if their overall functionality and gender dysphoria are unchanged. Gender dysphoria that is focused on breasts may simply move to hips or waist after the breasts are removed.  
   
Tordoff 2022 was an observational cohort study of 104 teens, with 7 on some kind of hormonal treatment for gender dysphoria at the beginning of the study and 69 being on such treatment by the end. The authors measured depression on the PHQ-9 scale at 3, 6, and 12 months, and reported ""60% lower odds of depression and 73% lower odds of suicidality among youths who had initiated PBs or GAHs compared with youths who had not."" This paper is widely cited as evidence for GAH, but the problem is that the treatment group did not actually improve. The authors are making a statistical argument that relies on the ""no treatment"" group getting worse. This would be bad enough by itself, but the deeper problem is that the apparent worsening of the non-GAH group can be explained by dropout effects. There were 35 teens not on GAH at the end of the study, but only 7 completed the final depression scale.  
   
The data in eTable 3 of the supplement is helpful. At the beginning the 7 teens on GAH and the 93 not on GAH have similar scores: 57-59% meeting depression criteria and 43-45% positive for self-harming or suicidal thoughts. There is some evidence of a temporary benefit from GAH at 3 months, when the 43 GAH teens were at 56% and 28% for depression and suicidality respectively, and the 38 non-GAH teens at 76% and 58%. At 6 months the 59 GAH teens and 24 non-GAH teens are both around 56-58% and 42-46% for depression and suicidality. At 12 months there appears to be a stark worsening of the non-GAH group, with 86% meeting both depression and suicidality criteria. However, this is because 6/7 = 86% and there are only 7 subjects reporting data out of the 35 not on GAH from the original 104 subject cohort. The actual depression rate for the GAH group remains stable around 56% throughout the study, and the rate of suicidality actually worsens from Month 3 to Month 12.  
   
We cannot assume that the remaining 7 are representative of the entire untreated 35. I suspect teens dropped out of this study because their gender dysphoria improved in its natural course, as many adolescent symptoms, identities and other concerns do. However, even if you disagree with me on this point, the question you have to ask about the Tordoff study is why these 7 teens would go to a gender clinic for a year and not receive GAH. Whatever the reason was, it makes them non-representative of gender dysphoric teens at a gender clinic.  
   
The short-term effect of GAH is no longer an unanswered question. Its theoretical basis was strong in the absence of data, but like many strong theories it has failed in the face of data. Now that two studies have failed to report meaningful benefit we can no longer say, as we could as recently as 2021, that the short-term benefits are so strong that they outweigh the potential long-term risks inherent in permanent body modification. Some non-trivial number of patients come to regret these body modifications, and we can no longer claim in good faith that there are enormous short term benefits that outweigh this risk. The gender affirming clinicians had two bites at the apple to find the benefit that they claimed would justify these dramatic interventions, and their failure to find it is much greater than I could have imagined two years ago.  
   
I am not unaware of how fraught and politicized this topic has become, but the time has come to admit that we, even the moderates like me, were wrong. When a teenager is distressed by their gender or gendered traits, altering their body with hormones does not help their distress. I suspect, but cannot yet prove, that the gender affirming model is actively harmful, and this is why these gender studies do not have the same methodological problem of large placebo effect size that plagues so much research in psychiatry. When I do in depth chart reviews of suicidal twenty-something trans adults on my inpatient unit, I often see a pattern of a teenager who was uncomfortable with their body, ""affirmed"" in the belief that they were born in the wrong body (which is an idea that, whether right or wrong, is much harder to cope with than merely accepting that you are a masculine woman, or that you must learn to cope with disliking a specific aspect of your body), and their mental health gets worse and worse the more gender affirming treatments they receive. First, they are uncomfortable being traditionally feminine, then they feel ""fake"" after a social transition and masculine haircut, then they take testosterone and feel extremely depressed about ""being a man with breasts,"" then they have their breasts removed and feel suicidal about not having a penis. The belief that ""there is something wrong with my body"" is a cognitive distortion that has been affirmed instead of Socratically questioned with CBT, and the iatrogenic harm can be extreme.  
   
If we say we care about trans kids, that must mean caring about them enough to hold their treatments to the same standard of evidence we use for everything else. No one thinks that the way we ""care about Alzheimer's patients"" is allowing Biogen to have free rein marketing Aduhelm. The entire edifice of modern medical science is premised on the idea that we cannot assume we are helping people merely because we have good intentions and a good theory. If researchers from Harvard and UCSF could follow over 300 affirmed trans teens for 2 years, measure them with dozens of scales, and publish what they did, then the notion that GAH is helpful should be considered dubious until proven otherwise. Proving a negative is always tricky, but if half a dozen elite researchers scour my house looking for a cat and can't find one, then it is reasonable to conclude no cat exists. And it may no longer reasonable to consider the medicalization of vulnerable teenagers due to a theory that this cat might exist despite our best efforts to find it.

PS - To be clear, I support the civil rights of the trans community, even as I criticize their ideas. I see no more contradiction here than, for example, an atheist supporting religious freedom and being opposed to antisemitism. If an atheist can critique both the teachings and practices of hyper-Orthodox Hasidic Judaism, while being opposed to antisemitism at the same time, I believe that I can criticize the ideas of the trans community (""born in the wrong body"") while still supporting their civil rights and opposing transphobia in all forms.

averhoeven,"Thanks for this breakdown and analysis of the data. This might be the longest post I've ever read on Reddit. I think many have been skeptical of the increasing politicization of care that should be about the patients and not the ideology. And yet, in current circles as you've mentioned, it's become so politically taboo to even have the discussion or ask the question that a meaningful discussion cannot be had. I appreciate you being willing to put yourself out there to the mob per se and share an analysis of data which, frankly, most of us are never going to read or read that in depth because we have our own busy lives/practices. 
I'll be very interested to read any other educated perspectives on what you've said. As a pediatrician at my base, and one who often deals with significant teenage psychiatric comorbidities, I have a vested interest in the topic and a personal notion that something about how we currently perceive and treat all of this is flawed and potentially harmful.

The fact that it had been lauded as a positive study amazes me, especially with how the paper was structured to make you believe it is positive on a cursory reading when it really is not.

Your comparison to anabolic steroids is also one that I have mulled over frequently and am also surprised it doesn't help trans boys more. Testosterone is very powerful and seems to have an independent effect on mood.

The fact that CBT for gender dysphoria has been compared to gay conversation therapy is one of  the reasons we are stuck where we are.

meansofproduction20,"Prefacing my comments with: I have performed and will continue to perform gender affirming surgeries to consenting trans adults, and I support protecting the civil rights and social acceptance of trans people.

From an Ob-Gyn perspective, it has always concerned me the lack of focus on whether or not minors can consent to medications that may severely limit or eliminate their reproductive options later in life. In any patient who I counsel regarding permanent forms of contraception, it is always a very careful process. Additionally, even just for a salpingectomy (where actually patients technically still have the ability to get IVF, so their fertility options are not completely eliminated) Medicaid requires special consent forms signed 30 days before we can even do the surgery, after which time we only have a 6 month window. This is a protective measure to prevent patient coercion.

So as giving puberty blockers and then cross sex hormones which prevent sexual maturity is a decision that I am not sure a preadolescent has the ability to consent to, from a reproductive standpoint. I understand these are all risk/benefit decisions with parents, patients, and doctors, and I don’t want to minimize the importance of privacy when making medical decisions.

But at the same time, historically the field of Ob/Gyn has had to reckon with the ethical and societal consequences of giving permanent contraception to patients who either did not consent or could not give appropriate consent. And I hope appropriate guardrails are in place to prevent adolescent psychiatry, and associated fields involved in gender affirming care for minors, from eliminating/limiting fertility options in trans teens and kids, without appropriate consent. We won’t really know the answer to this for another 10+ years.","Subject: Invitation to Join Our Innovative Chronic Pain Management Study

SereneTranscription,"Psychiatrist pitching in, copying over a comment from /r/Psychiatry.

I do not see patients who are outright MtF or FtM in my outpatient practice very often, and when I do it is not for their gender issues specifically, but I do see many young people these days who are gender non-conforming in some way. I have several patients who go by ""she/they"" pronouns who are entirely unable to articulate why they prefer this to ""she/her"" apart from some extremely vague discomfort with entirely feminine pronouns. I am of course happy to accommodate whatever pronouns they like but it does make me wonder how much of this is social contagion combined with a generalised ""feeling uncomfortable in your own body"" which is entirely normal for those of a certain age group or with certain other (non-gender dysphoria) mental health concerns which would simply self-terminate if not labelled and reinforced.

At the same time, I somewhat frequently see gender dysphoria as part of a package deal with BPD in crisis (as in not present outside of crises) in my inpatient practice. My approach is often to call them whatever they want to be called, and refer to an outpatient gender clinic - but I wonder how much iatrogenic harm could be caused by a clinician with a different approach.

This is not your prototypical fundraiser–this is one small part of a concerted effort to implore a major U.S. Scleroderma center to conduct a potentially life-saving clinical trial. I tried to contact a couple of mods by messenger to get the green light to post this but haven’t heard anything back, and I’m submitting my letter, research, and petition to Johns Hopkins at the end of this week/beginning of next, so I’d like to amass as many signatures as I can get.

I'm in the process of drawing up a letter, some assorted research, and a petition calling on the Johns Hopkins Scleroderma Center to conduct a large-scale clinical trial of Therapeutic Plasma Exchange for the treatment of systemic sclerosis. I've created a [Change.org](http://Change.org) petition, and I'd love it if you had a look & signed! I'm sincerely hoping that, alongside my carefully-constructed letter and some research, a petition will help the head of the Clinical Trials department see that Scleroderma patients are interested in seeing this treatment break into the mainstream.

If it manages to get a halfway-decent number of signatures, I'll be submitting it alongside my letter & research to my contact at Johns Hopkins.

The pharmaceutical company AiCuris has asked us to connect to possible candidates for their clinical trial.

They are running a **Phase III trial on the efficacy and safety of Pritelivir, a viral enzyme inhibitor for Herpes Simplex Infections**.

In previous trials Pritelivir has shown higher efficacy than the approved medications Acyclovir and Valacyclovir, and it is effective also against strains that are resistant to the available medications.

The clinical trial is restricted to patients that have a higher need for a better medication; in particular to patients that suffer from an immunocompromised condition.

The **clinical trial of Pritelivir** accepts people that:

\- **have a HSV infection that is susceptible to acyclovir** (= it can be treated with acyclovir) or resistant to acyclovir

\- **are immunocompromised**. This definition includes many health conditions:

\-- diagnosed with **HIV** (a positive diagnosis is enough)

\-- or: diagnosed with an **autoimmune condition** (lupus, and many others) that require the use of immunosuppressant drugs

\-- or: diagnosed with **cancer**

&#x200B;

These people might suffer from the most severe outcomes when infected with Herpes Simplex. Therefore if you can, please bring this information to patients / clinics / advocacy groups that might benefit from it.

&#x200B;

More informations are available on the website of the clinical trial:

[https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03073967](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03073967) (part E)

and the possibility to take part to the clinical trial can be verified here:

[https://hsv-care.com/](https://hsv-care.com/)

At  the moment the clinical trial has study centers only in the US, but  they are going to open new centers across many countries in Europe and in China.
