    "title": "I hate having to accept my life without even knowing what\u2019s wrong with my body",
    "text": "I\u2019ve had chronic nerve pain and severe, bilateral paresthesia in both of my legs, for over a year and no doctors can figure it out. I\u2019ve spoken with 6 neurologists about it who agree there\u2019s no way it could be because of a few old, small herniated discs I have, but also can\u2019t figure out what\u2019s causing it. I can\u2019t really sit down anymore because it makes my nerves so angry, and I really just feel shitty almost all the time. I\u2019m on two medications for it, one that barely works and one that maybe has been helping but I just started it, so it\u2019s difficult to say.  \nI just don\u2019t know what to do. I hate that I have to accept it but I don\u2019t even know what\u2019s happening. This is the rest of my life. Yes. I understand that. I feel terrible about it most days, but if I\u2019m very strict with how I move and don\u2019t sit or do things that make my nerves angry I can get by relatively not horrible feeling. But I don\u2019t even know why it\u2019s happening. I hate that I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s happening. I hate that maybe there could be a treatment, but I don\u2019t know what it is, because I don\u2019t even know what\u2019s wrong with me. I hate that I will never be taken seriously about it by anyone because I don\u2019t have an answer for it. I hate that I can never get on disability, because I have no diagnosis, even though just daily life kills me if I\u2019m not living like an alien who barely steps out of line and I can\u2019t work. I hate that my life is ruined. I\u2019m just in such a weird place. It\u2019s so hard to accept this when no one knows why it\u2019s happening. My most recent neurology appointment said \u201cwe will do one more EMG and MRI of your lumbar plexus, and if that shows nothing your best bet might be clinical trials and seeing The Mayo Clinic.\u201d What the fuck is my life? I have New York insurance. I can\u2019t do shit anywhere else unless I\u2019m so interesting to a researcher that they take me on pro-bono for the love of the game. What do I even do with myself? I feel so aimless. I just want to be comfortable again. Even a piece of my body is completely numb and it\u2019s slowly spreading and I have no idea why. I constantly feel like my legs are being prickled by needles if I\u2019m not careful and they always tingle. It\u2019s just so distressing and overwhelming sometimes. I need to have more self restraint and stop trying to sit. I just miss my life. And myself. And how carefree everything was. I feel so fucking weird and I don\u2019t know where I\u2019m at. I just know my life is over, will continue to be over, and I will never be able to return to the type of carefree, physically able person I was before all of this garbage. And whenever I talk about it I\u2019m just told that I\u2019m depressing\u2014 that it\u2019s depressing that I have no hope in ever getting better. But I won\u2019t. I have to live like this and accept that it\u2019s over. This is the only life I get. Wishing for a miracle that will never exist will get me nowhere. There is no cure. There is no way to even know what is wrong with me. But I really am just miserable a lot of the time. I got told by the person performing the repeat EMG that I was \u201ca perfectly healthy 18 year old\u201d based off my nerve impulses. I think I\u2019m in hell. I\u2019m trying my best. It never ends, though. ",

I\u2019d suggest going to mt Sinai area around union square if you can they have top doctors that are super knowledgeable and super nice.

    "text": "Tldr I'm jaded from soooo many bad/useless Dr appointments, but starting them back up because I finally have insurance again, and partner thinks I should push for diagnoses instead of just asking for treatment for pain and symptoms. I'd rather focus on addressing the symptoms bc that's given me more relief than trying to test for things my Drs don't know what they're testing for.\n\nBasically the above, but for more context: I have no optimism about starting with this new PCP (I just moved, I haven't had a physical in 2 years because I've been moving a lot and I should get one to see where I'm at lab-wise at least) and based on not being taken seriously in the past with pretty much 100% of the doctors I've seen, I'm sort of over trying to find out what is causing my pain and *issues* and am just wanting to get treatment for my inflammation and nerve pain. I'm in PT for loose joints and in general, my PTs have helped loads more than any doctor has. I wish they were my PCPs.\n\nI never got an official EDS diagnosis (came to that myself after research and reddit, and one sorta helpful Chiro), but was put through a ton of expensive, unnecessary, and painful testing to rule out conditions I knew I didn't have (RA, carpal tunnel, etc) before my team of doctors gave up and I never went back. Literally, my neurologist said, \"Huh, I was positive it was carpal tunnel. I can't help you hun. I guess, don't bend your arms unnecessarily?\" to me asking how to treat my forearm+hand nerve pain and sensitivity, which gets worse when I bend my elbows a lot like when I drive, type, and do pretty much everything else in life.\n\nI've just stuck with saying I probably have a connective tissue disorder and an unknown nerve issue, plus old diagnoses for a migraine disorder and an ME/CFS diagnosis that might cover most of my symptoms because it's such an annoying condition, but that can't be cured because...it's ME/CFS and yea. (Yes I know more research is being done on it now bc of long COVID, I'm part of the clinical trial group and official condition org or whatever. That shit sucks. I will be asking about LDN though.) \n\nPartner thinks (and is partially right, I will acknowledge that) that I should push for diagnoses to get treatment for them instead of trying to skip and treat my most problematic symptoms. I've already improved somewhat over the years by doing things that target the symptoms (diet changes, PT, not laying in bed longer than 9 hours to avoid being crunchy), so I know it can be done but...\n\nWhat I'm asking I guess is, is it worth it, and how has any of y'all's decisions regarding symptoms vs diagnoses (if this is even a thing, I know I've read it somewhere on here) has helped/hurt. Thanks in advance and for reading my rant-y, annoyed novella. :)",

    "title": "In praise of an almost universal biomarker of diseases or the revolution of precision medecine",
    "text": "Hi,\n\nMany of you suffer from the lack of diagnosis and sometimes the lack of trust from doctors or family/friends or even yourself, as to wether you really have a disease, or wether you are \"faking it\" or simply psychosomatic (an actual medical condition).\n\nThe reason for this difficulty, is that many chronic illnesses symptoms are rather unspecific, even more so at the early stages (e.g. in the case of autoimmunity), such as unlocalized pain, tiredness, etc.\n\nI have studied the topic of cytotoxicity which is an almost universal common component of diseases and its biomarkers.\n\nWe have routine biomarkers that often allows to almost localize and or rule out entire organs, for example transaminases (and a few others) for the liver, lipase/amylase/glucose for the pancreas, creatinine for the kidney, creatine kinase for muscles and the heart, etc\n\nWhile those biomarkers are excellent for the above reasons, when they shows up negative there still remains a very large list of systemic diseases.\n\nDiseases are characterized by inflammation unfortunately CRP and ESR only shows up in a minority of inflammatory conditions.\n\nThere is another widely available biomarker, LDH, that by design quantify in a non organ selective way, the amount of cell death (because LDH is contained in every cells and is not normally present in much quantities in blood unless it leaks from dying cells)\n\nSo it is one of the closest thing we have that approximate an universal marker of inflammation and therefore of diseases. In light of this understanding, it has recently been tested on 48 diseases and found to shows up as elevated in 46 of the 48 diseases, which is impressive.\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8217520/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8217520/)\n\nThe normal range is up to 153 u/L but in many conditions it is only slighly elevated in the 150s-170s a result that is often ignored despite being indicative of disease activity.\n\nLDH serves three key purposes, 1) to observe that there is a disease activity/cytotoxicity 2) to quantify the extent of the systemic toxicity 3) to assess the effect of medications and supplements on cytotoxicity by observing or not an LDH reduction post treatment, consistently.\n\nWhile LDH is not truly universal and there are many diseases where it will *not* shows up, it still is according to this study the most broad biomarker of the presence of a disease.\n\nAnd in my opinion its use (complement and does not replace other biomarkers) for assessing 2) and 3) is underatted, being a direct marker of the quantity of cells death.\n\nIt is important to note that LDH is largely useless to actually diagnose *which* disease you have (unless it is extremely high) and this probably is why it is sadly underused in practice.\n\nThere are other markers that are even more universal than LDH, the markers of oxidative stress (such as malondialdehyde levels) however unfortunately those markers are a bit expensive contrary to LDH.\n\nWhile I'm at it, some specific biomarkers I consider are underused:\n\nFor neurodegenerative diseases, there is a recently developped, universal marker of brain neurons/axons damage. The neurofilament light chain in CSF.\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10380627/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10380627/)\n\nIt unfortunately is not available everywhere and it probably costly. Moreover while it assess for neurotoxicity and is useful for point 2) and 3), as for LDH, it usually does not allows a specific diagnosis, still their uses outlined are very useful and their broadeness in scope makes them particularly fit for people that fails to be diagnosed.\n\nAnother broad biomarker are free light chains in blood, the name is similar but their use is radically different. Except for a few conditions like amyloidosis, free light chains does not allows a specific diagnosis, however there are papers showing it often is elevated in many (most?) autoimmune diseases\n\nsuch as: Rheumatoid arthritis, sjogren\n\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16569685/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16569685/)\n\nlupus\n\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21312346/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21312346/)\n\netc\n\nAs for LDH, they do not allows a diagnosis, however they allows to quantify 2) disease activity and 3) the effect of medication(s)/supplements.\n\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24099109/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24099109/)\n\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21221683/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21221683/)\n\nFree lights chains are not proven to be an universal marker of autoimmunity but it stills is the most proven biomarker to shows up in different autoimmune diseases.\n\nThose recents scientific discoveries about correlates of old biomarkers, are in my opinion a scientific revolution for the clinical practice of chronic illnesses.\n\nAs said, while those markers won't always shows up they are the most broad ones available, they are widely available (except neurofilament), and hence is a major tool to help undiagnosed people to be considered and further investigated despite not allowing diagnosis.\n\nMoreover the ability to monitor disease severity and to partially (doesn't replace other biomarkers and methods) quantify the reduction in disease cytotoxicity by therapeutics is an essential tool of precision medicine that can improve the quality of life and prognosises of patients and allows for fast, empirical trial and error of different therapeutics instead of blindly believing the current therapeutic combination is empirically the optimal one (maximal reduction).",

    "text": "Just venting. I really hate insurance companies. \n\nI have refractory Myasthenia Gravis. I've had it for more than twenty years. The only things that work are Mestinon and IVIG. I've tried every immune suppressant, prednisone, all of it. Some of them twice around (long periods for each).\n\nThe only other thing that has made a difference was a clinical trial of Car-T (I'll make another post about that, it was great). But it's worn off and it will take a while to get back in. \n\nI was recently hospitalized for a myasthenic crisis. After five days of IVIG, several in the ICU, I finally got to go home, with strict instructions to resume IVIG. The insurance company denied it as \"too expensive.\"\n\nI called and explained that without IVIG, I would, with 100% certainty, end up in crisis, not breathing, and back in the ICU.  Which is much more expensive, I promise. \n\nTheir response?  \"Well, hospital stays are covered.\"\n\nI hate them so much. \n\nBetween my neurologist and myself, we did eventually get them to cover it, but it took way to long, and the pharmacy had to agree to write off the amount in excess of what insurance will pay for. I still hate them. \n\nThanks for reading my angry rant.  Love you all, and wishing you all the best. \ud83d\udc99",

Finding the root cause is no one's priority so they're going to try to explain your pain isn't caused by anything, it's all to do with your nervous system. \n\nIt's infuriating, the courses are CBT led. I did one for chronic back pain (and more) post cancer. They told me lovely stories about neural pathways. I'm still in pain. They wanted me to decrease medication which is the only thing that keeps me in a job and functioning.\n\nYou have my sympathies op. If you can try to get a referral to a rheumatologist or whatever is appropriate for your condition. \n\nI have a lot of feelings about these courses and this approach. I'm sure it works for some people - we had a visit from a wheelchair user who managed to get off all her medication and stop using the wheelchair. She also managed a 27 hour flight by \"practicing sitting\" for weeks in advance. \n\nI'm sorry, go in with an open mind, there will be some useful coping mechanisms in there.",

I have spent two years in a large amount of joint, hip and back pain and have been told over and over it is just my fibro\u2026just your fibro acting up\u2026.i know it doesn\u2019t present in the way fibromyalgia is usually described but that\u2019s what it is. I have no neuropathic pain whatsoever, which to me always seemed rather odd for a fibromyalgia diagnosis, no nerve pain, none of the described symptoms. I had a hard time relating to other fibro people in the group supports because I didn\u2019t know what they went through\u2026.i just had searing hot knee joints, a SI joint that makes walking and standing agony, and one egg sized knot that never seems to stop hurting on my back. I saw a rheumatologist who did some x rays two years ago, gave me this diagnosis and then moved away. \n\nFor two years I have been asking for imaging or blood tests and have been told \u201cfibro doesn\u2019t show on tests\u201d\u2026.i have been asking for better pain control and have been offered stuff for nerve pain or trigger point injections where I don\u2019t even have pain. I arranged to join a ketamine trial 2 hours from my house because it is supposed to do very well for neuropathic pain in fibromyalgia. It doesn\u2019t help much and makes me feel like absolute dog crap for two days. I begged a sports medicine doctor for a steroid injection in my SI joint and that was the only thing that relieved any pain and I could walk and stand for 3 weeks\u2026..at this point I got into the local university pain clinic I had been waitlisted for for over 2 years, they did blood tests but made sure to tell me that it probably wouldn\u2019t show anything and that it was most likely fibro\u2026.cause my pain does seem like fibro to them\u2026 well my rheumatoid factor is 196.00\u2026..normal is 10.00. I have an autoimmune issue no one bothered to test. Possibly early rheumatoid arthritis. (Early as in age I\u2019m 41)\n\nWithout that first lazy rheumatologist who wanted me off her books before she moved giving me a diagnosis without the proper tests could I have had two less years of pain? Two more mobile years with my children?  So much I missed because I couldn\u2019t walk, so much was brushed off as \u201cjust your fibro\u201d and not looked into any further.

    "text": "So, this week I got two new doctors.  Ugh!  I made a pact with some colleagues to start taking care of our health and doing our annual exams in November 2019.  At that point I hadn\u2019t seen a doctor other than for emergencies in decades.  I was told all my blood work came back bad after my physical and they wanted to recheck it to confirm.  It was confirmed that I had diabetes and high cholesterol and was out on meds.  My liver numbers were all bad and I was sent to a hepatologist.  That came back that I have NAFLD/Nash and was at the door of cirrhosis.  I got put in a clinical trial.  I had many GI issues over the next year and intestinal infections.  Then, the sponsor pulled the clinical trial, my hepatologist retired, and my GI had a baby and decided not to come back.  So, I went on the hunt for new doctors.  Found a good GI, they got me on meds that helped my stomach issues.  I got accepted at a patient at Duke for my liver stuff and I am currently being screened for a new trial.  I was referred to a rheumatologist to see if they could help with inflammatory and spine issues and was diagnosed with non-radiographic axial Spondyloarthritis and started on biologic injections.  Now, I have some issues with my oxygen levels randomly dropping during the day.  They se t me for a chest X-ray that came back fine so I got referred to a pulmonologist.  I have no idea what is happening there but I can\u2019t get in until February 17.  Then I keep having passing out spells so I got referred to sleep medicine and had a consult with them and have a series of tests that are being done now.  Oh, and I was just walking in October and two bones in my foot snapped.  They put me in Vitamin D that was severely low but my bones won\u2019t heal and now I have special shoes and a bone growth stimulator that was ordered.  I have to do that for two months and if it doesn\u2019t heal they will have to go in and re-break my foot in a way they can fix it because where the breaks are they don\u2019t have enough surface area to put plates and screws.  Ugh!  I am nervous about the upcoming tests.  I am wondering when I will be considered disabled and have to go through the SSDI process.",

    "title": "Sjogrens testing as a JOKE",
    "text": "Feel free to skip to the TLDR if you don't want the long story. \n\nI got diagnosed with POTS this year but I knew there was more than POTS going on. I recognized I have been having a dryness issue for a while now. I literally flakes off all over my arms if I use any kind of soap on it and essentially after a lot of trial and error I've learned to wipe them off as best as I can and use a moisturizer. This also led me to realize that my eyes are dry, like to the point of dramatically affecting my vision. \n\nSo I saw a doctor. Who ran a test called SS-A. It's a Sjogrens antibody test and it came back negative. I saw an eye doctor who tested my vision before and after treating dry eye issues with preservative free eye drops, hot compresses, and massaging a gland near the eye. Turns out, my vision improved by like 30 on both sides. They initially thought I would need eyeglasses and was actually driving illegally because of my vision being so bad. Gross, but turned out not to be true. They gave me a prescription for glasses because I've developed near sightedness and a stigmatism. Okay fine cool. Will the dry eyes ever go away or am I stuck with this eye routine forever? Doc doesn't know. I get the SS-A re-ran just in case. \n\nI pointed out that some sjogrens patients never test positive for SS-A because I researched it myself after it came back negative the first time. All the doctors I talked to after this are like \"yeah that's true but it's the only test we have\" so I'm like what the heck do I do now? I guess not worry about it since they aren't worried? I don't have dry mouth really. Just dry eyes.\n\nExcept two months after this I got diagnosed with MCAS. After finally getting it under control the swelling in my mouth is gone... But my mouth is incredibly dry not that the swelling is gone. I have a constant level of annoying pain and discomfort from the dryness. So I messaged my physical therapist who initially found MCAS. He sends me a crap ton of resources about sjogrens. Yeah turns out that the SS-A test only comes back positive after you've hit a certain point of progression in the disease... Which is why it's rare for people under 40 to get diagnosed. I'm 25, I don't want to wait 15 years for treatment for something that I now know because of the resources my physical therapist sent me can permanently damage your mouth, eyes, and other parts of your body. So I'm like dang. Why the crap has no one taken this concern seriously when I've brought up concerns about it?\n\nWell turns out there's additional tests they can run. It's called the early sjogrens antibody panel and they even listed three or four additional tests that can be helpful for diagnosis but are less specific to sjogrens. So guess what? Now I have to make a doctor's appointment and convince a new doctor that I'm meeting for the first time to order me tests they've probably never heard of! Yay! \n\nSo I did exactly that. I brought the resources from my physical therapist with me and I sat down with the doc and he was like yeah, never heard of these tests but I have heard of POTS and how a lot of conditions appear with it. So I show him the resources and go over the tests with him. The healthcare network I'm going to is THE BIG ONE in my area. The prestigious hospital and clinics. I'm talking the ONLY level 1 trauma center in the region! Like they service other states, like five other states besides my state. Literally people come for over six hours away to get care here because they have all the crazy specialists who specialize in the nitty gritty stuff. And guess what? They only have the nonspecific tests. They have SS-A and SS-B but nothing else sjogrens specific. \n\nBeing me I know there are other labs around. LabCorp and Quest aren't that far away. So I asked him to print out an order for the tests he couldn't get for me within his own health system (which in my opinion REALLY SHOULD HAVE THESE TESTS). I take that order and go to LabCorp who literally has the same exact tests the big Hospital health system I was just at had.  LabCorp is nationwide. Why the crap don't they have it? I take my order and leave. \n\nI look up Quest and I find the exact three tests that I still need listed under a test code on their website. Hallelujah I've found it! So I go to Quest and it just happens that there's only one employee there because of call outs and understaffing so they randomly can't take walk-ins. Yowch. She tells me to schedule an appointment and come back tomorrow. Alright, bet. I show her where my number is on the order and I tell her to call me if she has any questions because I've had trouble getting the test done. \n\nSo yeah about an hour later she calls me this conversation happens:\n\n\"We don't have this test, we have the one LabCorp and the big Hospital have\"\n\"nah you have it, I found it on your website, let me pull it up, one second\" \n\"I doubt it, I even called and asked my coworker who is really good at the test stuff and she says this is the only one we have\"\n\"I found it, it says it has the SP-1, PSP, and CA-6. I have a test code, would you like it?\" \n\"Wait, which one did you say it had?\"\n\"All of them\"\nPause\n\"What's the test code?\"\n\"######\" (I don't remember the number lol)\nPause\n\"Oh wow! It has all three of them right there together in one test!\"\n\"Yup\"\n\"Okay well I'll get this in and we will see you at your appointment!\"\n\"Awesome thanks, bye\"\n\n\nLike.... Just like.... Why???\n\nTo add a bit of context I used to work in healthcare and I input labs as part of my job. I think my background in this is the only reason I will be able to get the tests. Like gosh dang! What a nightmare! All for a condition that can literally attack organs in your body and cause some real awful permanent damage to you. I'm shaking my head at this and I'm also mad because I'm positive my physical therapist sent those resources to other people too and that they haven't been able to A) convince a doctor to order them to begin with B) convince them to order them despite not having the tests or ever hearing of it before C) know which labs are nationwide so you know you can check with them D) know how to check with the labs without help from staff because they don't know they have these tests\n\nI see my physical therapist tomorrow and I'm going to show him exactly how to get his patients this test. I see a more specialized cardiologist doctor in December who's so high up on the PhD chain that he meets with the board and the president of all the medical stuff for the whole hospital system. I know he's awesome already because my physical therapist reached out to him to get a medication prescribed and he called me and then prescribed it after talking to me despite never seeing me in the clinic. So I will be making a stink with him that they should frickin have these tests because I'm not the only one who needs them. \n\nAlso Quest has officially outcompeted LabCorp in my book, and has won over my business and support. Quest is awesome, despite their workers not knowing things. \n\nOh and a fun tidbit, the doctor who ordered the tests was genuinely shocked they hadn't run one of them on me before. He said it should be ran for POTS patients especially when they have CFS like I do because it's an autoimmune disease. If that test comes back with any abnormal markers I get a rhuematology referral! So fun!\n\n\nTLDR: I've seen multiple doctors about my dry eyes that could be sjogrens, they ran one test and gave up on it, they never told me that this disease can really permanently harm your body, and now that I got more info from my physical therapist of all doctors I had to see a new doc to get the lab ordered and I visited three labs today trying to get this done and have only ran into problems",

        "text": "Most pathways to diagnosis are a joke. They run a basic test, tell you \"oops, it's negative\" and then they move on. Meanwhile, you still have the exact same symptoms you've been having and zero answers. It's like, they think that just because something comes up negative that their job is done. Also, they gatekeep the hell out of tests and scans, for what reason? The logic of healthcare sometimes isn't logical at all. \n\nFor example, I have a vertebral body hemangioma. Most of the time, they don't cause any problems, sometimes, they spontaneously rupture and you can become suffer serious neurological effects or die. So... I asked my doctor about it. She tells me \"Oh, they're usually symptomless and never cause a problem. They really only become a problem if they grow. But, it's not something we typically monitor\" M'AM IF YOU DON'T TYPICALLY MONITOR IT, HOW DO YOU KNOW IF IT'S GROWING??? Like, that's basically like saying \"Yeah, it can kill you if it grows, but we're not even going to check if it's growing... so... basically, if it kills you, it kills you.\" \n\nSame goes for my thyroid nodule. Doctor tells me \"I don't think an ultrasound is necessary because thyroid nodules are common and usually not a problem.\" Cool, but I have a family history of thyroid disease and thyroid cancer... so like... scan please?? I had to beg her to write me a script for a thyroid ultrasound. It was already recommended by two other radiologists on reports for other scans I've had for different issues. Both scans picked up the nodule and the first radiology report noted \"A follow-up with dedicated sonography may be necessary\" and the second radiology report said \"A thyroid ultrasound is highly recommended.\" Like, if the radiologists are recommending a scan, obviously they don't think it's just a common normal thing. Otherwise, they would just say \"Common finding\" or something like that. \n\nIt's frustrating that some doctors give up so quickly. They run tests and then just say well I guess nothing's wrong, even though you have symptoms still.",

    "text": " My name is Bryn and I am a Clinical Research Coordinator at Massachusetts General Hospital.  I am looking for volunteers in New England to enroll for a clinical trial to investigate how medical cannabis can affect opioid use and pain. The goal of this study is to see whether medical cannabis might help people reduce their dose of opioid medications, while receiving support from clinicians to manage pain.\n\n Participants will receive up to $1,130 in payments, which are made monthly following the completion of each study visit. We are looking for people who:\n\n1. Are 18-75 years old\n2. Use prescription opioids for chronic pain\n3. Do not regularly use cannabis\n4. Are located in New England\n\nThe study will involve 3 components:\n\n1. A weekly Prescription Opioid Taper Support (POTS) group, where you will work with trained clinicians to learn pain management skills and create an individualized opioid reduction plan to match your goals. Groups meet weekly for 26 weeks over Zoom.\n2. Daily surveys, where you will be asked to complete a short (1-2 minute) survey on your phone each day to help keep track of your pain levels, medications, and health.\n3. 8 study visits, which are completed over 6 months, and can be done in person or via Zoom. Day and evening appointments are available.\n\n Many people think that medical cannabis may help with pain management or opioid medication reduction. This trial will help determine whether medical cannabis is helpful or not in patients with chronic pain on prescription opioids. You decide what types of medical cannabis products, how much, and how often you use. Medical cannabis and medical cannabis certificates will not be provided directly by this research study.\n\n If you are interested in this study and want to learn more, please fill out this short prescreening survey here ([https://redcap.link/5n90qllp](https://redcap.link/5n90qllp)), and we will contact you if you are eligible to participate. If you have any questions, call at 617-643-1984 or email [potsandmm@mgh.harvard.edu](mailto:potsandmm@mgh.harvard.edu), or you can find more information at [https://rally.massgeneralbrigham.org/study/potsmm](https://rally.massgeneralbrigham.org/study/potsmm).",

My doctor who prescribed this test was salty that I wouldn\u2019t get off of my antidepressants for the test, and claimed that the results were inconclusive because of my medications. The sleep test itself came back with mild sleep apnea (according to him).\nSo I\u2019m talking to the new person and she says, no, these results indicate moderate sleep apnea and mild narcolepsy. \nSo I\u2019ve been walking around with mild narcolepsy for years not knowing because my doctor was too salty to say anything. It honestly explains so much about my sleep problems, and I suspected it for a long time, but the last guy really made me feel like I was crazy for thinking that. We\u2019re now talking solutions and I\u2019m ranting to my therapist periodically\u2026 this is just so frustrating. ",

It made it difficult to stay upright even if I could tolerate the migraine.\n\nI don\u2019t have any ideas on the nausea. Hope you find some answers and solutions.",

Here are the details: \n\nStarted abruptly while at work 2 weeks ago episodes lasting for a varying amount of time. \n\nSymptoms at onset: Feeling flush, vision tunneling, clammy, muscles felt weak and shaky, felt like I was going to faint. No dizziness, no chest pain, no headache, no shortness of breath. \nTests done at onset: BP and orthostatic BP normal, HR did not increase (56bpm), EKG normal (sinus bradycardia noted), labs normal (troponin, cbc, cmp, electrolytes, magnesium, TSH, glucose, a1c, creatinine, bun, calcium). \nResolved with time, they did give fluids and zofran at the time.\n\nSince onset episode: \nConsistent feeling of head pressure, brain fog, lightheatedness throughout the day. When episodes happen, symptoms are the same as above minus the tunnel vision. \n\nEpisodes happen with even low level activity for example doing dishes or driving or going to lunch. \n\nLifestyle: Started a weight loss program 6 months ago of healthy eating and exercise, no medications, 30lbs down since start. Very active I do 30 min cardio 3x a week, weight train a 3x a week and do Muay Thai 1-2x. No pre workout or stimulants. I take vitamin D and b12 in the mornings and magnesium at night. I drink 1/2 to 1 gallon of water a day. \n\nNothing has improved the episodes, here\u2019s what I\u2019ve tried: \nEliminated caffeine, increased carbs, iron and fat rich foods, upped sodium, stopped all weight loss plans no workouts or specific meal plan, increased sugar (was no sugar except fruit), bed rested. \n\nTests I have ordered and I\u2019m waiting to do: eeg, head ct, holter monitor, sleep study. \n\nAny ideas much appreciated!

Increased exercise and water intake (+healthy eating, if you are avoiding carbohydrates/sugars) can cause low blood sugars. If you can get a blood glucose test done or buy a OTC glucometer to check I'd recommend! If you can't, try drinking some sugary juice (10g-15g of carbohydrates) when you feel and see if you feel better 5-20 minutes after drinking. Good luck, I hope you can find some answers!",

    "title": "I don't know if I can finish college, what should I do?",
    "text": "So I wasn't quite sure where to post this, please let me know if this might not be the right spot.\n\nSo I (21) began college fall 2021 majoring in social work, minoring in psychology, gender and women's studies, and art therapy. I should be graduating this spring, but I'm not. Over the past four years I've been brutally shown I was medically neglected and have gotten severely disabled. I missed a lot of classes, having to get incompletes or my grades suffered from absences, due to ER visits dr Apts or being sick. I've completed about 2\u00bd years worth of credits I believe? I did a lot of AP in high school. I was a straight A student k-12 but the second I hit college I struggled (which makes a bit sense with my disabilities) and I sit about 2.7 GPA\n\nI left my college and enrolled in Carlow's online program so I could work at my own pace and it's also a different state from where I live. Specifically the medical setting SWK program as I want to work in a hospital, like the ED or L&D.\n\nIssue is, my disabilities are getting in the way. Physically, I've been diagnosed with EDS, POTS (I'm the 1% that does faint often), degenerative disk disease (disease is misleading, this is more like a symptom of a larger problem I'm working with my PCP to figure out), and plantar faciitis. So I physically cannot be on my feet for hours at a time. I'm sure I could try to get accommodations but I know it's a fight. I use a walker, cane, wheelchair as needed. \n\nMy first classes were half a semester this semester and I failed (asking for an incomplete) because I moved and didn't have internet, but this was the period where my back pain escalated (THREE ER visits within 2\u00bd weeks) and I got my DDD diagnosis. I then caught pneumonia and was bedridden. It feels like I do this cycle often. \n\nSo I'm not sure if I should continue. I've drank the kool aid of sunken cost fallacy. I want to prove to myself I can do this, as I'm a first generation student, but I don't think my body is letting me. I know I'm intelligent and my mind is capable, but I need to be realistic. \n\nI currently work part time at my hospital's cancer center. I'm a clerk, working with EPIC making appointments, documenting interactions, working with nurses, etc. We do have a swk'er for this dept and I try to flag him down with any patients that are a red flag for needing help. I really love doing documentation, to the point nurses have thanked me for making their jobs just a smidge easier. A FT position is about to open up, my supervisor is leaving, and I want to get it, which of course has me worry about juggling school and work. I also worry about going FT since my doctors are only open the same times as my clinic so I'd have to take time off for my endless appointments. \n\nSo, I'll likely drop college. Is there any fields of work I should look into? I love my job, I really do, but the pay isn't a lot. It's above minimum (minimum is 16, I make 20 working minimum 20hrs a week it fluctuates) and I'm afraid I might not be able to survive off of this, I'm living paycheck to paycheck like most Americans. I don't want to waste the education I got and wanted, especially with the expensive loans. What can I do? I still want to work in healthcare. Am I just shit out of luck unfortunately since the world isn't accommodating to people like me? There is a decent trade school in my area, I'm not sure exactly what programs they offer. ",

        "text": "First off, I'm really sorry for everything you've been going through. I think something rarely discussed with chronic illness (because it's super hard to grapple with) is the grief of having things you want to do and being unable to do them. Being unable to stand for long periods of time when the work you want to do requires it is crushing. *hugs* I'm glad you have diagnoses that will hopefully guide you to helpful treatments and I wish you luck figuring out the rest.\n\nI obviously don't know everything, but to me it sounds like you're overworking yourself compared to the capability of your body. I say this because I did the same thing. During college I was constantly in and out of hospital, missing class, taking incompletes and switching to online in a desperate bid to finish what I started; all while working. It was rough so I completely sympathize. I'd get sick, get better, work my butt off to catch up, get sick, get better, and do it all over again. \n\nI thought it was forever. Of course this isn't a possibility for everyone, but once I slowed down and gave myself the space to be disabled? My symptoms improved. We have different limits from our able bodied peers, and it'd be nice if we'd get a handbook with our diagnoses but instead we have to find our limits on our own and write it ourselves. \n\nThat is to say; it sounds like you're working to find something that works for you and my hope is that, as it did for me, that in turn helps manage and improve your symptoms. It can suck to be confronted with the reality of disability but once you've faced that reality you can work to coexist with it. You might have to set aside some of your earlier wants, goals, or dreams, and sometimes you find new ones and sometimes you can pick them up again later. I just want you to know that maybe there's a sliver of light at the end of the tunnel while you're stuck in the middle of it in complete darkness. I hope any of that is helpful, since you mention that cycle you often go through. \n\nI had a pretty similar journey to you, including wanting to work in Healthcare, but similar to you I needed to be paid more and needed more flexibility for all the endless doctor appointments. \n\nActual clinic settings didn't work for me, especially private health, but working in health research (for the state/a university) did. It's more flexible, slower paced, and usually has better benefits (important for those of us that need consistant healthcare!) while still letting you help patients. Since you enjoy documentation and have experience in EPIC, something in the data sphere (think data management/analyst) or as a medical abstractor might be applicable. You don't always need a higher ed degree in a related field. \n\nMore than a specific job or field, a big piece of advice I'd give is: find ANY remote job. I didn't think there was a huge difference between sitting at a desk to work and sitting at home to work, but for my health that's made a HUGE difference. I know those are in high demand and we're all being paid like dirt, but another perk of a remote job is you can move further from your workplace and (hopefully) pay cheaper rent (if you are renting). I'll also tell you a little secret: sometimes jobs say \"hybrid\" but in reality you never go in to the office. I haven't been to the office in 4 years and my job is not officially remote. Don't discount that when job hunting. \n\nSetting aside work and turning to college, I know it's classic to do the 4 years and done thing but it's not really that common, even for the able bodied. It's not a failure to put it on hold, and in particular, putting it on hold doesn't mean you can't go back. Maybe you can't do it RIGHT NOW but that doesn't have to be the end of college. Especially if it's your dream. Maybe you need to slow down, pivot to finding a job that can support your body, take the time to find treatments that work for you, and maybe that takes years... but that just means that you're a pursuit predator and are gonna catch your dream of finishing college as a 1st gen student by chasing it at a sedate pace :)\n\nWishing you the best of luck because I don't think you're shit out of luck <3",

You\u2019ve been struggling for such a long time and it makes sense that you\u2019d be completely exhausted and burned out. I know a lot of us here can relate to this and understand how hopeless and pointless it all feels sometimes. \n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re grieving your past, present, and future all at once. Grief is a normal part of chronic illness, but it\u2019s a really difficult (and ongoing) process and not something you should have to go through alone. I\u2019m glad that you\u2019re seeing a psychologist, do you think that they\u2019re providing the help that you need? A therapist who has experience specifically with helping people with chronic illness and grief may be able to support you better. \n\nLiving with chronic illness is a full-time job. It doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t still live a fulfilling life, but it does mean you\u2019ll have to find different paths than you thought. I promise that there is not only one road to a life that feels worthwhile for you. But I know how devastating it feels to have so much seem completely unreachable. \n\nFrom what you\u2019ve said, it seems clear to me that you NEED more help than you\u2019re getting. You\u2019re going through so much, and trying to keep up with school on top of everything else sounds like more than should be expected of you. You need more support and less pressure to recover from years of burning yourself out trying so hard to keep up. Can you please talk to your doctors, psychologist, guardians, and school counselor about how you can get more accommodations for school? There are a lot of ways that schools can make things easier for anyone dealing with chronic illness or disability, including extending deadlines and allowing you more time at home to rest when you need it. It would even be okay if you needed to take time off of school entirely to focus on your health. I know you\u2019re worried about your future, but nothing is more important than taking care of yourself right now in the present.",

My experience has always been that they\u2019re empathetic, they take me to be an expert on my body, they believe what I\u2019m saying, they\u2019re resourceful. They do what needs to be done.\n\nUntil yesterday. \n\nI went in for a for a breast check because I found a lump on my breast. \n\nBefore asking me any questions or doing the breast exam she dismissed it as a lump due to my cycle.

It\u2019s not cancerous and the likelihood of mines being cancerous is low so no need to worry. \n\nGreat.\n\nThen when I brought up my concerns about having a mammogram, citing some studies I\u2019ve looked at and books I\u2019ve read, and asked if there are alternatives to it, she literally scoffed at me. I had to ask her what the alternatives were multiples times before she answered. \n\nOh but it gets better!\n\nShe does the breast check and is visually surprised when she feels the lump. \u201cOh you do actually have a lump here!\u201d Then she goes to say that if it is cancer, I don\u2019t need to worry! Because breast cancer is the easiest cancer to treat and it\u2019s not that big of a deal!

        "text": "Some viruses, such as the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), have been linked to autoimmune diseases. For example, chronic EBV infection in epithelial cells has been linked to systemic lupus erythematosus and Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome. Chronic or recurrent infection in B cells has been associated with rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. \n\nOther tests that may be used to diagnose autoimmune disorders include:             \nAntinuclear antibody (ANA) test.             \nA common first test that looks for antibodies that can cause autoimmune problems.                     \nExtractable nuclear antigen (ENA) test.                     \nA follow-up test that checks for antinuclear antibodies that are markers of certain diseases.                       \nC3 and C4 complement test.                      \nA blood test that measures levels of proteins that can be elevated in autoimmune disease or other.               inflammatory conditions.              \n\nOther tests that may be used include:          \nAutoantibody tests.                    \nComplete blood count (CBC) with white blood cell       differential (CBC with WBC differential)                             \nComprehensive metabolic panel.                     \nC-reactive protein (CRP)                                  \nErythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)                \nUrinalysis.                                      \nRheumatoid factor test.   \n\nIntrinsic dysautonomia, also known as secondary dysautonomia, is a condition that occurs when a disease damages the nerves of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). The ANS controls the body's automatic functions, such as heart rate, blood pressure, digestion, and temperature control. When the nerves in the ANS don't work properly, people with dysautonomia have trouble regulating these systems, which can lead to a variety of symptoms. \n\nSome possible causes of intrinsic dysautonomia include: Amyloidosis, Autoimmune disorders, Celiac disease, Chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), Crohn's disease, HIV, Lyme disease, Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS), Muscular sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Rheumatoid arthritis, and Vitamin deficiencies. \n\nCommon symptoms of dysautonomia: postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), anhydrosis or hyperhidrosis, blurry or double vision, bowel incontinence, brain fog, constipation, dizziness, difficulty swallowing, exercise intolerance, and low blood pressure. A referral to a neurologist or electrophysiologist is warranted. \n\nWaking up in the middle of the night could be a cortisol issue. Have you seen an Endocronologist? Have you heard of MCAS or histamine intolerance? Or small fiber neuropathy (SFN)? Ask for a referral to an Allergist/Immunologist. It can cause histamine dumps in the middle of the night.\n\nMy experience: I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia in December 2023. Every medication I tried failed and made all my symptoms worse. I developed dysautonomia/orthostatic intolerance and hyperesthesia. I had covid in 2022. It turned into Long covid. I had bronchitis and pneumonia a total of three times. I used an asthma inhaler for six months. I don't have asthma. Symptoms seemed to subside for nearly six months. And then all hell broke loose.\nI was diagnosed with ME/CFS in May.\n\nAll medications I took to manage it made me worse. I stopped taking both sertraline and clonazepam. I have tried duloxetine twice and milnacipran (SNRIS), amitriptyline (TCA), alzolpram (benzodiazepines), propanolol and metoprolol XR (beta blockers). Some medications managed certain symptoms. And made other symptoms worse or caused other problems. \n\nMy doctor also prescribed several medications for the wrong reasons. He believed I had anxiety and hypertension. Beta blockers caused orthostatic hypotension and worsened other dysautonomia symptoms. My dysautonomia/orthostatic intolerance, tachycardia, and adrenaline dumps were made worse. I was diagnosed with ME/CFS in May. Most likely from long covid. I've since been diagnosed with Hashimoto's disease, an autoimmune hypothyroidism. \n\nI've noticed I cycle through options approximately every three months. I can tell in a relatively short period of time, whether on not medications may be beneficial to me. It took nearly a month to determine that the two medications (amitriptyline and propranolol) I took didn't work well together or separately. I was on them for two months with significant improvements in sleep and pain. I was devastated when I stopped both. \n\nI did more research. I learned about aggressive rest, pacing, and PEM. Most doctors don't know much about this. Unless you're able to go to a long covid or ME/CFS clinic. I had to learn myself about my triggers, what I can and can't do, and how to manage my expectations.\n\nMy doctor has really stepped up in recent months. I think I'm his most complex case. I don't think he knew much about long covid/ME/CFS before me. But he is learning. He's now prescribing medications that manage symptoms. And he's providing referrals to specialists. There are 200 symptoms of long covid.\n\nIn the beginning, I was freaking out. That's completely normal. Please learn about resting, pacing, and avoid PEM as much as possible. That includes all exertion: mental, emotional, and physical. \n\nI had severe brain fog. I would misuse words. I would misplace words and space out in the middle of conversations. I had trouble walking. All my muscles were weak. I had continuous orthostatic intolerance/tachycardia/adrenaline dumps. I was always dizzy, lightheaded, hot, and sweaty, with increased pulse rate, shortness of breath, and air hunger. There have been times I thought I was actually dying. When a non-diabetic nocturnal hypoglycemia attack landed me in the ER. The changes I've made have been monumental in lowering the most debilitating symptoms. I don't have anxiety. I've learned what these attacks are and how to handle them. If I allowed myself to give in to my anxiety, my symptoms would be so much worse. \n\nI'm taking low-dose fluvoxamine 12.5mg for ME/CFS symptoms and diazepam for dysautonomia as needed. Cyclobenzaprine and nabumetone for pain and hydroxyzine for sleep. I take Nuvana a whole food multivitamin with 100% of 21 vitamins & minerals, \nprobiotics, and tumeric.  It's an all-in-one vitamin. I take Magnesiu-OM powder (magnesium 3 types and L-theanine) mixed in tart cherry juice (melatonin and tryptophan) 1-2 hours before bed.\n\nFluvoxamine is an SSRI used for OCD. It's prescribed off-label in low-dose for long covid/ME/CFS symptoms. I'm seeing improvements in REM, deep sleep, and overall hours slept. I'm seeing improvements in dysautonomia symptoms and orthostatic intolerance. I was sick for four days, similar to stomach flu. I'm certain the fluvoxamine is helping. It was the only medication I took for those four days. My other medications are as needed, thankfully.  Fluvoxamine is medication #9 that I've tried this year. Don't give up.\n\nI hope you're able to work with doctors to get some answers. I know how hard it is. I hope something here is helpful. Hugs\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude03\ud83e\udd0d",

    "text": "I'm  so angry, of course I  looked at the side effects. The first year it was fine. It helped actually , I thanked the doctor who prescibed it thinking my \"nerve pain\" and rocky mental health would go away.\n\n Over time I became more and more fatigued. I had to sit down on the floor if waiting line,  it felt like i had concrete in my shoes to walk or stand still for a few mins. I grew more detached from my hobbies and my joy for life. 2 years in and i had no job and was throwing money and time at trying everything i could to get better.\n\nYEAR 3/4  I was forced to quit my one day a week college class (as i was trying to reskill in something less demanding) and trying to accept i have a chronic tiredness that may always exist  I was trying adapt and accept my position. I really thought it might be in my head. I continued to spend as much money as i could afford on trying to get well. Then I started becoming very easily irritated,  soaking the bed with sweat every night, grinding my teeth, suffered insomnia, heart palpitations, horrendous anxiety... the list goes on.\n\nMy doctors tried to treat these symtoms individually with u guessed it, more medication! At this point i realised how much medication they were putting me on and decided to check if there were interactions etc. I looked at the  side effects of all my meds, which is when the penny dropped. \n\nI am so glad to be off it even though  my taper was incredible fast (my doctor reccomend 20mg  drop per 2 weeks) the withdrawal was one of the worst experiences of my life and may have damaged some of my relationships due to how unstable I  was.\n\nI have a renewed hatred of big pharma and the system that does not allow doctors to do their jobs properly.  I wish someone had checked the fucking side effects- my symtoms line up like ducks ffs. Plus I'm not sure any study says its safe to use for more than one year. \n\nI've learnt a lot about taking responsibility for my own health along with a lot of trauma that'll  keep my therapist in buisness for a few years. \n\nMy disability is a connective tissue issue and I believe   a lot of us are being neglected and gaslit. I believe I was being  treated with a group of drugs used to treat fibromyalgia.  I hope that that research on hsd /heds blood biomarkers (EDS UK  society has the artical ) becomes a reliable test soon. This may save so many of us searching for an answer, who are reacting badly to these antidepressants they keep giving us for the pain. \n\nEven more abysmal than my continuing lack of faith in western medicine is my discovery that no, depression isnt a lack of seratonin and no, no one has ever \"found mental illness\" in the brain. I was a young person in depressing circumstances. I don't  think i had depression. We're the canaries in the coal mine. Maybe my brain isn't the problem maybe it's the lack of safe affordable housing, jobs, support and healthcare and I will not be medicated out of this fight by that zombiefying drug.  (If it helped you that's  great! This post isn't for you) Peace.\n\n I am going to enjoy my life as much as i can. One day  I'll be able to celebrate. ",

Earlier today I set aside folding laundry and spent a few nice minutes staring out the window at three crows who were all trying to perch on the top of a pine tree.\u00a0\n\n\nWorth it. \ud83d\ude0a",

My house always looks like I'm battling a poltergeist at any given moment. And I'm just honest with people, I can't take care of the house like they could when there are days even feeding myself takes too much effort and I simply don't eat because I don't have the strength.

I'm technically not full time bc I'm only taking 9 credit hours, but I am a biology major, and pursuing my degree takes all of my energy.  Sometimes I can stay awake for a whole day bc of prescription stimulants, but most of the time (despite the meds), I need a 1-3 hour nap. When I can stay awake all day, I still struggle with groggy periods (come and go, last an hour or two) where my eyes feel heavy and it's hard to focus.\n\nI really want (and need) to spend more time studying outside of my apartment, because there are fewer distractions and I'm always more productive, but I usually stay home so I can nap when I need to. I'm considering taking my next semester off to dedicate my time to getting a diagnosis & (hopefully) treatment, but I'm halfway through my fall semester right now and I want to finish it strong. I was wondering if you all had tips for how to manage fatigue in university/public places (while I'm waiting on a diagnosis)? Do you take power naps? Use eye drops? Please let me know if you have any tips! \n\n*^(DISCLAIMER: I absolutely will not consider any advice as substitute for actual medical advice or treatment.

    "text": "As the title states, everything is turning upside down. I seem to have fallen off of a cliff in September. Ever since September 12, everything has happened at the speed of fucking light and it's getting worse by the week or even day. My malnutrition symptoms have gotten significantly worse and I can't function. I genuinely look like I need to be in the hospital. I look like a skeleton and have crazy bags under my eyes. The only reason I haven't sought admission is because my labs are stable and ERs won't care as a result. At this point in time, I'm having serious considerations about a fucking feeding tube. It wouldn't have gone to this point if we figured this out sooner. I'm thankful for an amazing PCP that is willing to take me seriously and listen to my concerns. \n\nI now have to take a leave of absence from nursing school. I'm missing clinical hours. Studying for exams is near impossible. List goes on. This is probably the worst part of the entire ordeal. It's the classic \"I had aspiring dreams that I'm not sure I'll be able to obtain\". I hold medicine close to me after growing up in and out of the hospital. I know this will make me a better nurse and blah blah blah. However, I've already served my time as a patient. I've had 17 surgeries in my lifetime by age 21. Hell, I've even had the full psych ward experience! I know both ends of the spectrum. Was that NOT enough to satisfy them? I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE THEY WANT FROM ME.\n\nI don't know what this means for me in terms of housing. I'm lucky that my parents are willing to pay rent if I'm in school. So, I'm not sure what that will look like since I'm going on medical leave and won't be in school. My lease ends in August 2025. If I don't get my shit together by then, there's a chance I'll be forced to move back with my emotionally immature parents because they won't be willing to cover rent. My parents are emotionally immature. They'll cover anything related to physical needs: food, shelter, water, heat, etc. However, they're emotionally distant and my mom is well known to push boundaries. It's become an issue with my sister, sister in law, my brother, and me. \n\nI ALSO don't have a therapist. MY LAST ONE FELL THROUGH THE WEEK I GOT DIAGNOSED WITH EPI. He's in the midst of being trained in for trauma clients and therefore lacks experience. I am one of those clients and have CPTSD. It's not his fault since you don't know what you don't know. However, it's still disheartening to be left without mental health services in the midst of an altering life event. I'm seeking a new one but I'm only have outpatient psychiatry in terms of services. My psychiatrist does know about this issue and is genuinely interested in helping.\n\nThis last part mentions eating disorders. Here's an obligatory TW.\n\nI'm so pissed at my sister. I told her about my EPI and malabsorption issue. She immediately made it about her eating disorder.... One of the first things she said to me was, \"It could be worse. I'm jealous that you lost weight and can eat anything you want without gaining weight. Take advantage of it while you can!\" There is no \"while you can\". EPI is lifelong. I'll forever struggle with nutrition now because of it.\n\nI had to explain to her the difference between eating disorder vs disordered eating. I have disordered eating that's the result of GI symptoms. However, disordered eating is not the same as an eating disorder. She said that I have an eating disorder and said \"you just flipped the words around.\" I had to explain to her that I'm fucking miserable because of malnutrition and the symptoms are out of control. Yet, she didn't care at all. There was 0 acknowledgement whatsoever.\n\nShe also went into the whole \"I wanna lose weight by January, I ate x calories today, and have x calories left in the budget for the day!\" Like... dude. I'm telling you that I have a lifelong health issue and you're making it about your eating disorder. You're allowed to struggle with an eating disorder and that's a valid problem in of itself. However, that doesn't give you the right to be a jerk. In fact, she should know better than that! She has an eating disorder. You would expect that they'd be more sensitive about nutrition and weight. I guess not.\n\nAnyways, I'm fed up with life. Thank you for coming to my vent session.",

    "text": "I'm running into an issue that is beyond frustrating to me. I love my medical team for the most part. I was a mixture of lucky to have some of the doctors I do, but I also I requested many specialists by name to my team. But fuck none of the communicate, or bother to understand what's wrong with me outside of their specific specialities.\n\nI have a lot wrong with me, and not everything is commonly comorbid, which is feeding this frustration. First, I was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. My neuro is fantastic, and specializes in MS (total lucky accident) and has been ontop of my treatment for that. He also diagnosed me with Recurring Migraines both with and without aura. \n\nMy Rheumatologist and cardiologist diagnosed me with POTS, Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, Raynauds Disease, Sjogrens Syndrome, an unspecified nerve disorder, and some gastro stuff - which I'm still liking into with my gi specialist. To top off my diagnoses, I also have endometriosis. Still doing digging because ddyspraxia and dystonia are also things I seem to suffer from but I need to see a dysautonomia specialist (which I can't because they have 5+ years booked solid so they aren't taking anyone new)\n\nNow where my problems lie are with the fact that these disorders all have a wide issues of symptoms, and all of them don't play nicely with each other, especially when you start to treat symptoms. And my doctors are struggling with that, because they crossover into specialties that are clueless about my issues.\n\nFor example, my neuro put me on triptans for my migraines. Totally fine, except the triptans are something to be avoided with Raynauds as it severely worsens my symptoms. (My hands and feet were so cold they were nearly blue from taking it) I warned him prior, but was told \"oh don't worry about those medicines to avoid list as they aren't accurate for everyone\". His tune changed instantly when I sent him photos of my hands and the medical studies backing that this is a common issue with triptans and raynauds.\n\nOr when my GP (who I go to for referrals) keeps focusing on my low blood pressure being caused by \"a medicine my neuro put me on for my migraines\" when that wasn't the cause at all. I had just had a freaking root canal 3 weeks prior, and had an infection in my jaw, which I didn't get to mention to him because he super focused on my low blood pressure that badly. He refused to believe it was caused by anything other than my migraine meds. Then when he did the laying down to standing bp/hr test he proceeded to lose it at my standing 148 hr, saying how that was dangerous. Like bro that's my EVERY DAY. And I kept trying to tell him and he just couldn't wrap his head around it. (He was so bad and so ignorant with that brashbattitude of I know more than you but it was clear the moment he saw everything wrong with me he was in WAY over his head. I literally am seeking a new gp after thay appointment.)\n\nOr when my Rheumatologist put me on Plaquenil for long term without explaining why he did so - because I don't have Lupus or RA so why am I on it? He made sure I did the eye exam first, but once I started it within a week insomnia, insane anxiety, stomach and right side abdominal pains, shooting chest pains that dropped me to my knees. Thankfully I got approved to stop it, but I can't figure out why it was started to begin with. It didn't help with a single issue, only worsened everything. \n\nAnd with my endo, I tried muscle Relaxers- which triggered my EDS and had me in complete dislocations sporadically. I normally subluxation frequently, but ive never fully dislocated until this. And it was like, I woke up from sleep to my shoulder completely dislocated. I then tried hormones, which did the same thing to me. So now, we're at surgery, which I'm anxious about because of the commonality in organ prolapse. Plus I'm worried about waking up in surgery. So like I'm SO anxious about that because what if they don't give me the right med combo? What if I wake up again? What if I feel them cutting me? It's happened twice as a minor in foot surgery. \n\nOr when my neuro looked at my spine xrays and mri's - which had me laying flat to position my spine properly - and he noted I have mild scoliosis. But in reality when I stand I feel a disc in my neck literally tuck under the next disc - thats not just scoliosis. I'm vent with my neck constantly craving forward. Or when I vocalize fear about my lower back seriously getting stiff/locking up, because of the EDS, but my neuro dismisses me to talk to my pt, who has made it clear this is a doctor thing cause I may need injections.

    "text": "So I made a post a couple months back basically venting about the troubles of being undiagnosed. Well, they\u2019ve narrowed down the diagnosis to early rheumatoid arthritis or UCTD. We\u2019re pretty sure it\u2019s more likely to be rheumatoid, as I have all of the symptoms, and my test results were positive, but not quite positive enough. But my doctor is very sure something is wrong autoimmune wise. I am relieved to finally know what is wrong with my body, but there\u2019s also this grief behind it. I now know that this autoimmune disease is forever. I don\u2019t really know how to navigate that. At least there is a way to symptom manage and treat it with medication. On top of this new diagnosis and grief, I am so fucking burnt out. I have been sick for a month. I am finally getting better and my fever has gone down, it was mostly just a low grade fever, which my doctor said happens with rheumatoid. The fever really impacted me and made my fatigue SOOO bad, and caused flare ups as well. I transferred to a new university and got a second job, I have so many commitments with the sober program I am in. I have had almost no energy to study or work but i\u2019ve been pushing myself through it because I don\u2019t have a choice not to. I guess i am wondering what people do when going through chronic illness related burnout, but don\u2019t have the option to take a break. Every time I take a break my responsibilities pile up and I have even more to do. And because of this, i\u2019m so focused on work and school and giving myself a bare minimum of rest, that it\u2019s very difficult to take care of myself. Does anyone have any advice on burnout or grieving a new autoimmune/chronic health diagnosis. Plss help!!!",

    "text": "Hi folks, longtime lurker and I just needed to rant in a place where maybe someone could understand.\n\nI (20f) have been dealing with bilateral joint pain and swelling in my feet, knees, hips, elbows, and fingers for the last six months. Coupled with the constant fatigue it has been a struggle to go to work and complete my studies in university, I am even struggling to do basic household tasks like walking a dog. On bad days I will wake up with a joint so stiff I can barely move it, which makes working my retail job very difficult as I am on my feet all day and am constantly lifting 50+ lbs.\n\nWhen I first discussed these issues with my GP he told me it was fibro, without having done any tests, and very reluctantly referred me to a rheumatologist. I had to wait for four months to see this rheumatologist, and when I did get an appointment she did a very brief and surprisingly rough assessment of my joints, and told me there was no swelling. I have pictures documenting the swelling in my hands a feet, and have had an assessment done on all of my joints by a physiotherapist, who found swelling. She also said it can't be swelling if it is present in the mornings and evenings, but gets better about an hour after I wake up. The rheum reluctantly ordered an ultrasound on my hands and feet, however I don't know if it went through because I haven't been able to get in contact with the ultrasound clinic for two weeks.\n\nI had to beg for her to do blood tests, and my rnp antibodies from the ena screen came back positive, which is the first thing to ever show on my blood work. I have not heard anything back from the rheumatologist office, and my GP did not know what an ena screen was so I cannot go to him for help.\n\nSorry for the long explanation, I just wanted to provide context. I am struggling to get accommodations from school and work because no one really knows what is wrong with me, and I feel like I can't really plan for anything more than a couple months in advance because I never know what I am going to be capable of. I'm just so tired of being in pain. I am on a waitlist for a chronic pain clinic but the wait is two years. \n\nI feel like the Healthcare providers I am seeing are not willing to listen to what I have to say  and how severely this is affecting me. My province is not terribly fond of Healthcare, so I know it is only going to get worse with more medical professionals leaving.\n\nI am worried that there is damage being done to my joints that could affect me long term or later down the line.\n\nI think most of all I am angry. About how I have been treated, how it is making me feel, and about how much of my youth I am no longer able to experience due to limited mobility.\n\nI don't know where to go from here, and I am worried that I could spend a decent chunk of my life dealing with something that no one cares enough to figure out.\n\nIf you made it this far, thank you \ud83d\udc95",

    "text": "Can anyone give me some advice, I'm really unsure what to do in this situation? I had an epipen Sunday night for an anaphylaxis reaction (yay new allergies), but due to the rest of my health I am still dealing with the after effects of the epipen, multiple antihistamines, and steroid shot. I feel awful. But I'm in college, with a quiz tomorrow I'm not prepared for, and a presentation Thursday that I just began researching for. I found out about both late last week, and the epipen has completely derailed my health this week, yesterday was supposed to go towards splitting half the load as my weekend was unavailable for school work (prior commitments) but instead everything was left to today because I could barely get out of bed yesterday. I did manage to get a little studying done before I had the reaction on Sunday though, so I shouldn't completely fail the quiz. I'm waiting for a response back from my pcp to get blood work, as I feel I've gotten an electrolyte imbalance now (something I unfortunately have had multiple times and the ER forgot to check for and I was too out of it to advocate for myself). I've got a migraine and chest pains I can not get rid of, feel overly tired and achy. I already know I have a b12 and folic acid deficiency that I can't get in to get treated until later this month (it was found by another doctor's office who told me to go to my pcp) and I have no doubt that it has either gotten worse or is contributing. My asthma has also been exasperated as a result of the reaction, and I'm considering calling my pulmonologist for temporary steroids. I have paralysis episodes that are treated by potassium (suspected hypokalemic periodic paralysis that hasn't been diagnosed yet) and I had one last night that I had to take my emergency potassium for, which further supports that my entire week has been thrown off by Sunday night. I've even had an unexplained nose bleed and can't get the smell of blood out of my nose, but thats the least of my concerns right now. I want to email my professors, let them know I will still be in class this week, but none of my work will be to my usual standards. My mom says its a bad idea, but I really don't know how to manage right now, I'm not looking for extentions or even grace on grading, just wanting to acknowledge that the work I turn in is going to be absolutely terrible this week and I'm probably not going to be much involved in class discussions this week. For some context, my school is very small and all my professors are aware of my health to varying degrees. Any thoughts? It's the second week of school, and I feel like I'm five minutes from dying and I had a really good week last week so I don't want my professors to think I'm purposely slacking this week.",

In contrast, mice that were injected with antibodies from healthy people were unaffected, demonstrating that patient antibodies cause, or at least are a major contributor to the disease.\n\nFurthermore, the mice injected with fibromyalgia antibodies recovered after a few weeks, when antibodies had been cleared from their system. This finding strongly suggests that therapies which reduce antibody levels in patients are likely to be effective treatments. Such therapies are already available and are used to treat other disorders that are caused by autoantibodies.\n\nCurrent estimates suggest that at least 1 in 40 people are affected by FMS worldwide (80% of which are women) and is commonly characterised by widespread pain throughout the body, as well as fatigue (often referred to as \u2018fibro fog\u2019) and emotional distress. It most commonly develops between the ages of 25 and 55, although children can also get it.\n\nDr Andreas Goebel, the study\u2019s principle clinical investigator from the University of Liverpool said, \u201cWhen I initiated this study in the UK, I expected that some fibromyalgia cases may be autoimmune. But David\u2019s team have discovered pain-causing antibodies in each recruited patient. The results offer amazing hope that the invisible, devastating symptoms of fibromyalgia will become treatable.\u201d\n\nProfessor Camilla Svensson, the study\u2019s primary investigator from Karolinska Institute said, \u201cAntibodies from people with FMS living in two different countries, the UK and Sweden, gave similar results, which adds enormous strength to our findings. The next step will be to identify what factors the symptom-inducing antibodies bind to. This will help us not only in terms of developing novel treatment strategies for FMS, but also of blood-based tests for diagnosis, which are missing today.\n\n>Dr Craig Bullock, Research Discovery and Innovations Lead at Versus Arthritis\n\nThis study was possible thanks to funding from the Medical Research Council (UK), Versus Arthritis, the Liverpool Pain Relief Foundation, the Swedish Research Council, the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, a donation from the Lundblad Family for clinical pain research at Karolinska Institute, and other agencies.",

I\u2019ve only watched one new show to completion, and that was while I still had covid too!

I\u2019ve been able to do research like I used to, in that regard. \n\nBut it\u2019s a potentially interesting phenomenon. I know not everyone here can relate, but if you do, how does it present for you? Could this be driving some of the current media fascination on with nostalgia? After all, we are not a small community, unfortunately; many more since covid have joined the chronically ill from before. ",

I've mainly just been listening to podcasts/audiobooks while doing some manual task like walking, sewing, folding clothes, etc. I think doing something with my hands/body helps me focus.

For a show, it usually takes a lot longer to watch it in full in comparison to how I could get through several seasons of a show very quickly a few years back. \n\nWatching something I've already seen takes a lot less mental energy, because I already know what's going to happen (therefore I'm prepared for any emotional responses) and I don't have to pay as much attention to what's going on. \n\nThe same goes for books as well, though it's harder to read overall these days. And music - I need to be in a good headspace to listen to new music, otherwise struggle to enjoy it and take it in. I also find I need to dedicate time to focusing on music to really take in new songs, which I never used to have to do until the last year or so.",

    "text": "So, I've learned that I pretty much put myself in the ICU because I ignored acute pain signals in my body.  Like what my doctors and I thought was a neurological disorder or disease was actually extreme levels of adrenaline damaging my brain.\n\nAfter a lot of processing I realized that because of my Autism and constant mental abuse of dismissal of my pain levels from my highly suspected Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, I was pretty much trained up until the point of cognitively dismissing such high pain signals that I stopped recognizing it.  After a serious (and I mean really bad) injury in January from a dog yanking my arm back on a flexi (dog trainer, not my dog, and I tripped), I knew the injury was bad cognitively and laughed it off.  I knew the shocks coming from my face to my ribcage and down my left arm was severe.  And I continued.\n\nFinally got an MRI a few weeks ago after my ICU trip because of neurological respiratory failure to see if the swelling was from a torn bicep or whatever, and everything was structurally normal.  \n\nA few days ago I finally connected that I have been living with acute pain from my spine collapsing and severe nerve damage, along with \"mild\" EDS joint pain, for 5 months, before it shut my brain down.  The \"narcoleptic\" attacks while driving and cooking, which used my left arm, was me passing out from pain.  \n\nEvery research I try to find talks about acute and chronic, but it doesn't talk about chronic acute pain.  I guess most people with my pain levels wouldn't be alive or have worked full time for months.  But there's studies of Autistic people have neurological deficits in processing pain.  And there are studies of chronic stress.\n\nIf there are no studies, then I found my reason to go back to school!  (And I say this while probably still in pain...)\n\nBut I'd love to see if there are studies of people ignoring pain to the point near death, autistic or not.",

    "text": "I am writing here because I have almost no network of people to support me. The only family I talk to is my dad and sister. Out of the few close friends and my small family of those that I talk to, none of them truly understand. I am not sure what I am looking for here. Maybe some kindness and short stories from people who relate but still find happiness in their life? I grew up with always being told that \u201csomeone is always having it worse than you\u201d which has caused me for many years to not seek medical help (both physical and mentally) when it was needed, so please don\u2019t comment things like \u201chow it could be worse\u201d - because I know that it could. It doesn\u2019t comfort me one bit. I just feel very sorry for the people who DO have it worse. either way.. here we go\u2026\n\nIt is currently hard to accept it all, since the bad news just keeps piling on.\n I just recently had a chiropractor conclude that I have osteoarthritis in my neck and a twisted vertebrae, which induces migraines ever so often. The doctors never checked for osteoarthritis, because I am far too young for that to even be a suspicion. But an x-ray by specialists brought in those bad news.. I have narcolepsy which went undiagnosed for 17 years. I am on the \u201cthird choice\u201d of medication, Wakix, which is preferred to only be used as mono-therapy because it clashes with a lot of other medications in how it is broken down in the liver, as well as the risk of prolonged QT interval. Wakix is not often used to treat Narcolepsy, I was told. This means that I have several times now been \u201cpatient zero\u201d where some researchers had to do studies on interactions between different medicaments and wakix. There just aren\u2019t enough data.\n\nWhy is that relevant to this? Because it limits all other treatment options for my other issues.\n\nIdeopatic gastroparesis is one of those issues. I feel a constant nausea, but the anti-nausea medication can\u2019t be used because of Wakix. So I have go into surgery to try and relieve the symptoms. I struggle in following the diet advised for gastroparesis, but it limits me so much in my daily life. Also since I got IBS as well, it creates trouble. IBS diet is very bad for gastroparesis, and gastroparesis diet is bad for IBS.\n\nAfter a decade of increasing amounts of bodily pain, countless of doctor visits, hospital visits, tests and tubes, the doctors gave up on finding out what causes the pain. They came to the conclusion that it is a problem in my spine and brain that makes my body interpret non-pain signals as pain. This pain presents itself in aching joints and a burning sensation on my skin. They come and go, can be triggered by a change in weather, temperature or just occur out of nothing. Some days I wake up crying in pain because everything that touches my skin causes pain. I was only just informed about this \u201cdiagnosis\u201d earlier this week. So they wanted to prescribe medications for me, which once again because of Wakix made it difficult. There is only 1 medication they can try, but there is a tiny risk of this one also causing prolonged QT. so I need monitorisation of my heart to make sure it doesn\u2019t cause more damage.\n\nI have other symptoms that they can\u2019t explain either\u2026\n\nAnd somehow with all this going on I am managing a full time job. Because of this I have almost no energy left when I get off from work. I can still do creative things at home where I am sitting down or lying down while drawing on my ipad, but I can\u2019t handle the sound of other people, nor can I manage to have a conversation. Friends have overall stopped asking me to hang out, because I keep declining due to the fatigue. I have only 1 friend who persistently asks me to hang out and do stuff, even if he gets a no more than 9 out of 10 times. And forget all about going out to eat with friends\u2026\nBut mostly it feels like they just got tired of waiting for me to get better. In stead I got worse and worse. I find it so hard to accept that this is my life. That I might not be able to work until I reach the retirement age - if I will even reach retirement age at all. I struggle in forming bonds with people, because I always feel like I am a burden to those around me. Don\u2019t even get me stared on the dating scene. I don\u2019t want to die, but some nights I think otherwise. If this is what my life is going to be for the next maybe 30 years? 40? 60? It feels like things just can\u2019t become \u201cokay\u201d. I hate having to take so many pills every day - it makes me feel broken.\n\nHow do you deal with this? How do you manage?",

Do you even notice the Wakix helping your symptoms or relieving pain because if not then maybe you should consider that the Wakix doesn't work. If it doesn't then that means your essentially getting no help or medicine because thw medicine you are taking doesn't work.\u00a0They might also say not to take anything else with Wakix because they want to moniter what effect it has on your body and don't want any 3rd party messing with their results. That's bullshit.\n\n\nIt's your body and if you continue to feel pain and the medicine doesn't offer relief and you should ask for other medicine. DO NOT read this and immediately go cold turkey, I am not a doctor or med provider but have been told constantly by my med provider that if the medicine I'm taking doesn't work or I feel no effect to reach out because then that medicine isn't right for me.\n\n\nDid you also know that some medicine just doesn't work for some people? I had a blood draw where they were able to find out what medicine would be most effective. One antidepressant might be what someone was missing and offer them immense relief but for another person that antidepressant could have no effect or even make their symptoms worse.\n\n\nAdvocate for your health, you're a human who feels pain and shouldn't have to put up with people pumping you with meds to see what will happen just to see why.\u00a0\n\n\nFor support reddit has helped me a lot, they're other forums that could help and perhaps you could find a discord that could introduce you to more people.

The knowledge that I have been struggling for so much time and had so little help is weighing heavily on me.\n\n  \nI still want to work and have been making progress on my own projects and critical tasks, but I also just feel extra touchy these days when people have time-sensitive requests.

    "text": "Hi all,\n\nI'm 24, and I've been trying to fight with the healthcare system in west coast Canada for awhile now, and I'm at a loss. Doctors are either confused, at a loss, accusing me of faking symptoms, telling me I should give up in my search for answers, etc. It is absolutely exhausting, and tiring. I've had an especially difficult run in with the specialists I've recently seen, but I'm trying my best to keep pushing, and to keep attempting to figure this out.\n\n.\n\nThe thing that is terrifying me the most lately is the dramatic worsening of my visual symptoms almost by the day now. Floaters, sensitivity to light, general blurriness is now worsening, slowly and almost by the day. However, here is a full list of the most persistent symptoms I'm dealing with are as follows: \n\n\u25aa\ufe0f Floaters in vision, such as translucent to transparent strings, specs, or webs of clearish floaters, plus small black floaters in some areas of my vision. The floaters are continually worsening. \n\n\u25aa\ufe0f blurry vision, ontop of floaters, my vision has generally become blurrier, and is worsening very slightly nearly daily, and glasses can no longer correct vision fully, even in areas where floaters are not present. \n\n\u25aa\ufe0f visual symptoms worsen in the evenings generally, sometimes eyes temporarily lose focus, and everything close and far becomes extremely blurry, making reading, or looking at screens difficult. \n\n\u25aa\ufe0f Bright objects or light now seem to cause some sort of glare as of recently ontop of the sensitivity to light. \n\n\u25aa\ufe0f eye pain, throbbing, stinging, or feeling like something is in my eye is common. \n\n\u25aa\ufe0f sensitivity to light in eyes. Even looking at bright text on a screen, and moving my eyes completely away from the screen, I can still see a foggy glare from the bright text, the type of glate you'd get from looking at the sun, except now it occurs even from text on a screen especially when it is dark.\n\n\u25aa\ufe0f general eye sensitivity, reading (whether on paper, or screens) and looking at screens in general, or being outdoors causes eye strain symptoms almost immediately, and symptoms worsen throughout the day, feeling less intense in the morning. It becomes more difficult to keep my eyes open as the day goes on. Especially in lit environments. \n\n\u25aa\ufe0f neck pain, and popping/scratching sensations in my neck, as well as pain in my head, especially when sitting, or laying down with a pillow, or when walking, or moving, these sensations exasperate, especially in my neck. An increase in visual blurry symptoms tends to occur alongside neck pain. \n\n\u25aa\ufe0f mild muscle twitching. Nothing dramatic, but eyes among other things twitch often. Rarely do more major arm or even more rarely, leg twitching occurs. Sometimes I feel twitching in the front of my forehead which is the weirdest feeling ever? \n\n\u25aa\ufe0f issues sleeping, mostly because it seems to be difficult to get in a comfy position nowadays, plus general restlessness when attempting to fall asleep, or occasionally waking throughout the night, or waking too early, though I do often reach 8ish hours of rest, with periods where it becomes more difficult to get that.\n\n\u25aa\ufe0f headaches are frequent too\n\n\u25aa\ufe0f also had one ocular migraine this winter/early spring after 9 years without no migraines (not since i was 15, when i used to get them regularly). \n\n\u25aa\ufe0f a general feeling all over my body with many joints constantly making popping, or clicking sounds and sensations a lot\n\n\u25aa\ufe0f skin issues, such as a mild rosaceae type skin issue on my face, and drier/flakier skin than usual on my hands.\n\n\u25aa\ufe0f quick to prune fingers. You know how your hands generally take a hot minute to prune when in water? Like for most, it may take quite awhile. For me, as of recently, they now prune in about 1 or 2 minutes of being in contact with water, and take about 30 to 45 minutes to revert to normal afterwards. \n\n\u25aa\ufe0f periodically, my ears randomly ring quite badly. This is not consistent. \n\n\u25aa\ufe0f i in general feel sickly with mild bodywide aches, almost as if i have a mild cold, but it has been months, to half a year of having those sickly feelings. They come and go sometimes. \n\n\u25aa\ufe0f i sometimes get a weird feeling in my stomach, though this is a rarer symptom\n\n\u25aa\ufe0f sometimes it feels like my heart is racing for no reason. \n\n\u25aa\ufe0f brain fog can become pretty intense too\n\n\u25aa\ufe0f mental health has directly been negatively impacted by these symptoms. \n\n.\n\nPain symptoms first started 2 years ago, visual symptoms started about 1 to 1.5 years ago, and initially progressed quite slowly, but now worsen quite quickly, exponentially. \n\nSome things that exasperate my symptoms, include:\n\n\u25aa\ufe0f laying down in any position with a pillow or raised headrest. This causes increased neck pain, and for some reason, my eyes feel strained and vision can get blurrier too.\n\n\u25aa\ufe0f sitting on couch, or computer chair. This causes pain in neck, dizziness, that weird twitching feeling in my forehead, eye twitches, soreness in extremeties. \n\n\u25aa\ufe0f light hurts my eyes! \n\nMost symptoms just slowly get worse day after day unimpacted by my actions. \n\nFor treatments, and exercises I've tried, along with corresponding effects, more info below!\n\n.\n\nWhat have doctors tested me for? + the results?\n\n\u25aa\ufe0f I've had several blood tests for lupus, sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, lime disease, autoimmune markers, diabetes, inflammation markers, pretty much all vitamin and supplement levels, including vitamin D, B, iron levels, etc, and thyroid functions as well, ALL OF WHICH WERE NEGATIVE, OR NORMAL!\n\n\u25aa\ufe0f I've also had an MRI in November, which showed only a mild disc protrusion + mild arthritis in the C4/C5 area of my spine, but no other abnormalities for a shoulders and up scan! \n\n\u25aa\ufe0f fine motor skills and movements have been tested, and it shows no signs of degenerative neurological conditions, such as MS, or neuropathy!\n\n\u25aa\ufe0f nerve conduction studies on wrists, arms, and legs have shown nothing. \n\n\u25aa\ufe0f optometrists, and an ophthalmologist have done thorough and full exams of my eyes, and they DID identify the floaters, but everything else test wise came back negative with no clear signs or reason as to why there are the floaters, or issues with my vision. Eyes were found to be dry too, I guess, but regular use of eye drops (including gel ones) have no impact or offer no relief of symptoms other than easing sore eyes just for a quick moment (but no impact on floaters and blurriness). Glasses also no longer fully fix my vision, especially the floaters. \n\n\u25aa\ufe0f ECG test which shows no abnormalities. \n\n\u25aa\ufe0f sometimes blood pressure is too high, or too low, but not consistently, nor is it impacted by sitting up, or getting up from a laying down position. \n\n\u25aa\ufe0f sleep apnea testing was done, and came back with no abnormalities. \n\nThat's everything for testing!\n\n.\n\nWhen it comes to treatments and exercises, I've tried several things. However access to these is limited, due to being on disability income. Many have been accessed through subsidies or sliding scale situations if they are a service. So below, I have everything I've tried, plus the effects of each. \n\n\u25aa\ufe0f massage therapy (mostly from college students), has often left me feeling the same, or worse afterwards. \n\n\u25aa\ufe0f chiropractor, had some positive effects on mobility and range, but had no effect on pain, or vision. Only tried once because of cost. Couldn't justify a second treatment.\n\n\u25aa\ufe0f yoga, tried a free weekly yoga class which had no positive effects, other than slightly elevated mental health, after the classes were over. Also, I deeply struggled to keep up with the class as an unfit person in a fast paced class. I've hurt myself attempting yoga at home also, so I'm not comfortable doing it without the guidance of an instructor, or friend of which I currently do not have friends who can guide me in this type of exercise locally. \n\n\u25aa\ufe0f stretches and nerve flossing exercises seem to have positive effects on mobility, but do not seem to help with pain, or visual issues.\n\n\u25aa\ufe0f i take daily 1hr 30min walks 5 to 7 times a week, other than keeping me mobile, and keeping me sane, it seems to have no other positive effects. \n\n\u25aa\ufe0f i try to maintain a healthy diet too when eating meals, though I do struggle with my addiction to sugars and comfort junk snack foods oftentimes. \n\n\u25aa\ufe0f eye drops, sometimes relieve the pain but do not stop, or reverse the progression of visual symptoms. \n\nI wish I could afford physical therapy otherwise that'd be what I'd try next. \n\n.\n\nI'm at a loss. Whatever is happening is not responding well to these exercises, or treatments. I'm here asking not for direct medical advice, but what other conditions I can ask my doctor to look into. We've tested me for everything common, but doctors refuse to look into anything rarer, so give me some other conditions to research, and push for testing for! Or other tests in general that I haven't listed yet that I could push for!\n\nDespite doctors and specialists telling me to give up, to just live with it, etc, I refuse to give up. Especially because symptoms are worsening daily now. It isn't exactly easy to \"just live with\" when symptoms progress daily now (though incrementally). Also, I've shown many doctors my list of symptoms, and I've been labeled as \"obsessive\" because I'm symptom tracking. \n\nSpecifically, I'd like to know more about other conditions that specifically cause floaters and visual issues of this nature. Asking Google only suggests conditions directly related to the eyes, like macular degeneration. So what conditions can cause these symptoms indirectly? Common, and rarer conditions? Like diabetes for example has a side effect of causing these types of visual issues when untreated, though as stated already, I've tested negatively for that. I'm just saying this as an example. \n\nSo what other conditions could potentially cause this, that are worth pushing my doctor to test for? Any non degenerative (or harder to diagnose) neurological conditions (that also don't impact fine motor skills)? Cardiovascular issues? Harder to diagnose autoimmune issues? I'm just at a loss. I'm also extremely terrified of reaching a point where I may no longer be able to rely on my vision (probably my biggest fear). \n\nThank you all for any suggestions, or ideas on how to navigate this! Whatever you all come up with will help me in my journey to fight the medical system for answers! \n\nAt the end of it all, I just want answers, and a new direction to point doctors in for this search. \n",

The floaters and other visual effects you describe sound very similar to the description of the visual impairment that can accompany migraines. A lot of people think of migraine as a headache disorder, but the headache is just one part of it and often the other symptoms (especially the visual ones you describe) often have a worse effect on functioning. Migraines can also disrupt your autonomic nervous system, causing fluctuating blood pressure and heart rate during onset. The extreme sensitivity to light and neck pain are also common migraine symptoms that made me wonder if that could be part of this.",

I'd also emphasize that they're worsening over time - floaters can get worse with age but they're not *really* supposed to quickly get worse quickly without cause. Did your ophthalmologist say anything about vitreous traction or detachement?\n\n\nUnfortunately there's not a lot of good treatments for floaters that already exist - you can look into supplements like VitreousHealth but the research behind them isn't super great.

If I need to be somewhere early, my amazing family steps up and is happy to help me pull it off. \n\nThen this NP got pissed I sleep 9-11 hours most nights.

When I informed her I\u2019ve btdt and it leaves me so tired I can\u2019t function, this happened: \n\nNp: You need to just make it work! \n\nMe: if I only sleep 6 hours, I literally fall asleep while driving!

I had a sleep study forever ago and it showed apnea (OSA) and I was supposed to get an oral appliance (like a funky retainer) but that doctor deleted a bunch of files and quit. So my data was lost.

    "text": "EDIT 9/2024: After 10 months, my mom started being taken more seriously and has been put on a diet that works for her, and she just reached 100 lbs for the first time in 6 YEARS! (since she got the stomach surgery). Unfortunately, we just found out she needs a lung transplant due to smoking for 40+ years, the damage to her lungs would not be repaired so the whole lung needs to be changed. We don't know anything about this kind of surgery so we're pretty scared, but I'm confident with the way technology has advanced the surgery will go well & she'll be okay, we have started using a health network that takes her complaints seriously and started giving her the right meds & even sent a nurse to our house when she got out of the hospital a month ago! I'm just very happy she actually got her condition taken seriously, and thank you to everyone and your advice!! Actually gaining the confidence to speak up for my mom has basically saved her life, I cannot thank you all enough!! \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\u2764\n\n\n\nSorry if I used the wrong flair, I don't post on Reddit at all LOL\n\nCW for ED mention and weight loss\n\nI (16F) think my mom (58F) has gastroparesis especially after doing research and recording her symptoms, but when she tells doctors about my theory they laugh in her face about Google and self diagnosing.\n\nMy mom has been looked at by a good amount of doctors from many different places (Long Island, NYC, Pennsylvania, Salem) and any time they look at her they can never figure out what's wrong and categorize her as extremely malnourished, she's even gotten questions about having an eating disorder. It's gotten to a point where friends who have known her almost her entire life are telling her to go to a MENTAL hospital. Like WTF??My mom has told me on numerous occasions that she doesn't want to be skinny at all, she went from being 140-150 lbs to 75 in 2 years..She hasn't had any symptoms until she got a third of her stomach removed due to a bleeding pancreas, and she has almost every single symptom of gastroparesis to a tee (or whatever the phrase is, you get the idea). She was sent to the hospital the other day because she had a really bad flare up, like keeling over and sobbing bad. She had to get her gallbladder removed yesterday because it was extremely enflamed so they're hoping that's what was wrong, but she's also had these stomach issues since 2018 right after part of her stomach was removed, which can also cause gastroparesis. When she brought this up to the doctor, he asked if I was studying to be a doctor. When I said no, he laughed and said everyone's a doctor with Google. Idk.. she's just been through so much and seeing my mom basically fade away from how much weight she's lost and no one can figure out what's wrong with her is making me so upset. Hopefully the gallbladder surgery will help at least a little with her eating, but I'm still fully convinced she has gastroparesis. I just hate how nobody is taking us seriously, ESPECIALLY when I have a whole list of her symptoms and how they match up with it.\n\nI just had to get that out somewhere and here felt right, I hope I'm not invading because I'm personally not chronically ill but my mom has been ill with back problems, mental issues, stomach issues, etc etc for my entire life. :(\n\nEDIT: bleeding ULCER not pancreas sorry LOL\n\nEDIT 2: This got WAY more attention than I was anticipating.. thank you so much to everyone for the advice! I hate seeing my mom suffer and the healthcare system has failed her time and time again, now I'm at an age where I can actually try and figure out what she's going through so I'm trying my hardest to make sure she's seen and heard. No, I don't want to be a doctor I actually want to work in the toy industry LOL\n\nHopefully last edit for now: My mom has talked to a different doctor and nurse (pretty sure it was her surgeon? not too sure all she said was doctor lmao) and told them what I said to her and they said it could definitely be that but they want to do a test on her thyroid first to make 100% sure that's not the problem (for reference for the whole 25+ years she's been in and out of hospitals and seeing hundreds of doctors none of them have ever tested her thyroid to see if it was causing any issues) so hopefully the thyroid is the problem and they can remove it, not her stomach. i think she'd flip out if i told her she'd probably need to be put on a feeding tube AGAIN if she has gastroparesis for real \ud83d\ude16",

    "text": "I\u2019m currently in the ICU for a severe endometriosis flare, a POTS flare, DKA, severe malnourishment and dehydration and possible kidney stones.  Safe to say I\u2019m going through hell.  \n\nFor the last 3 weeks, I\u2019ve been having constant, severe symptoms like severe nausea, dizziness, vertigo, constant period for 3 weeks and pelvic pain from endometriosis, POTS flare up, and more.  It seems like I\u2019m having a severe endometriosis flare up since my severe symptoms started exactly when I got a heavy and painful period, and the period hasn\u2019t stopped for 3 weeks despite being on birth control.  I\u2019ve been hospitalized 3 times over the last 3 weeks, and sent home by the previous 2 hospitals because they couldn\u2019t find anything and \u201ccouldn\u2019t do anything more for me\u201d.  I haven\u2019t been able to eat more than a few very small bites of food per day and a few sips of water.  The nausea is treatment resistant and severe, and I haven\u2019t found any relief yet.  I have a phobia of nausea and vomiting so this is particularly traumatic for me.  \n\nMost doctors say I present as having diabetes induced gastroparesis, and while the symptoms so present as that, I\u2019ve had excellent glycemic control and every endocrinologist I\u2019ve seen is confused that I would have such a sudden onset of gastroparesis when I barely had symptoms before 3 weeks ago.  Luckily I have a wonderful medical student who is really advocating for the endometriosis side of things, but I\u2019m too malnourished and weak to go into a laparoscopy to remove endometriosis.  My gyn wants to start me on an IUD but that was supposed to be with laparoscopy, so we\u2019ll see how that turns out.  I\u2019m currently on an insulin drip to get me out of DKA, and it took them 15 hours to get me pain meds for what they described as kidney stone pain.  I was in severe, agonizing pain for 15 hours as I begged them to give me something until they finally gave me morphine, but I\u2019m not sure if that aggravated my nausea worse because I\u2019ve been trying not to throw up for the last few hours.  I feel like I have to choose between pain and nausea.  Pain causes nausea, and nausea makes me want to die, so there\u2019s not a great option.  Like I said, my nausea is treatment resistant and I\u2019ve tried a multitude of different medications to get some relief, but no luck.  \n\nThis is wearing down my mental health to the point I\u2019m considering refusing life saving care because I\u2019m so tired.  I don\u2019t want to go through one more second of this, it\u2019s incredibly hard to move on.  I want this nightmare to be over. ",

A few years ago I started suffering from these debilitating migraines that cost most of my middle school and currently half my high school years. Even though I have seen a neurologist and was diagnosed with Chronic Migraines I believe that it may be something deeper such as POTs, for the last few years I have brought up my symtoms to other people and even a few who do have POTs and my symtoms almost match up with most of theirs. Should I bring it up when I see my neurologist again in a few months or see my primary doctor and go from there? I'm looking for more answers and better treatment options than being forced to rely on triptan medications that do little to nothing. I've been to physical therapy, had MRIs, etc. School is becoming very hard to keep going everyday(not like I have a choice) and I'm hoping to find a better treatment option if there's more to the chronic migraines.",

Chronic fatigue, brain fog and hard time speaking clearly/quickly, severe cold intolerance, cold hands/feet, puffy face and eyes, low body temperature (around 96), low appetite, hair shedding, dry/cracking skin and nails, brittle and dry hair (even my hairdresser called it hypo hair and insists I have it), and chicken skin. \n\nI\u2019ve tested my thyroid a few times over the years but labs come back normal (TSH 1.8 - 3 and normal FT3 and FT4 and antibodies negative). Only potential indication of thyroid issues is that my thyroid is shrinking (now 5.6 ml but normal for a woman is 10 - 15 ml), positive ANA, and low growth hormone (pituitary). I am working with so many doctors but they prevent me from getting testing at every turn. Don\u2019t approve labs, ultrasounds, and now won\u2019t let me do an MRI. I have paid so much from my own pocket but don\u2019t think I will be able to keep working if I can\u2019t get treatment soon. \n\nI have optimized my full iron panel, vitamin D, b12, and got my zinc up and iodine is a little low but I\u2019ve been adding it back to my diet. I have no idea what else this could be. I have been treated for individual symptoms with no success (minoxidil for hair, supplementation, etc.. I did notice that all my symptoms got worse after a quack doctor thought I had low estrogen and gave me estrogen patches. I ripped it off after two days and figured out I actually have high estrogen (which I\u2019ve heard can impact the thyroid as well). \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do anymore. I have been sick so long but get no help from doctors. I signed up for Cleveland clinic consult but that has a six month wait list, an endo I want to see in Chicago is booked until June. I have been gaslit so much I question if this is how I always was and I don\u2019t remember, or am aiming for much better than I will ever get in this life. I can\u2019t go on with no diagnosis. Even if I will never get better, I can\u2019t even have closure without a diagnosis to come to terms with. I am at an all-time low and my thoughts have gotten very dark and dangerous. \n\nWhat can I do now? I am so out of hope and options. I am realizing I am fighting a fight I can\u2019t win. ",

    "title": "Struggling with Stress-Induced Myofascial pain and Dandruff: Seeking Advice and Resources",
    "text": "It all started after a long night of playing phone games 8 years ago. I was trying to get my phone as close as possible to the router because of Wi-Fi issues at our house. The next morning, I woke up with tension in my back, which progressively worsened. Soon, I was waking up in the middle of the night, feeling like someone was stabbing me in the back.\n\nI visited a rheumatologist, who diagnosed me with a \"scoliotic attitude\" and recommended regular exercise and physical therapy. I followed their advice, but the pain and tightness never improved. In fact, things got worse, especially after tough workouts. I developed neck and eye pain, and my jaw was full of trigger points. Eventually, I also developed IBS.\n\nOver time, I realized that nearly every muscle in my body was riddled with trigger points, which severely impacted my quality of life. I had to quit boxing because my shoulders hurt every time I threw a punch. Some days were better than others, and I learned to live with the pain, which became somewhat manageable.\n\nThen, one day after taking a hot bath, I noticed my skin was red and flaky. My scalp also changed\u2014it became perpetually itchy and covered in strange dandruff that wouldn\u2019t go away. I visited multiple dermatologists who prescribed everything from corticosteroids to antifungal and antibacterial treatments, oil baths, and sulfate-free shampoos, but nothing helped. My dandruff and itchiness only got worse.  I felt like the healthcare system was failing me at this point so I stopped going to doctors altogether.\n\nOver time, I\u2019ve continued developing more and more symptoms and bodily changes, to the point where it\u2019s hard to keep track of them all. Sometimes, I feel like it\u2019s not worth addressing them because they seem so minor, but other times they feel overwhelming and seriously impact my daily life.\n\nEventually, I learned that all of my symptoms were exacerbated by stress and anxiety (though I haven\u2019t been officially diagnosed with anxiety, I suspect I have it, as my mother also struggles with severe anxiety). I began practicing relaxation techniques like conscious muscle relaxation, meditation and breathing exercises, which help manage my symptoms to some extent\u2014but they never fully go away.\n\nWhenever I face deadlines at work or school, all of my symptoms flare up. Despite all the relaxing I try to do, I end up feeling physically sick. I get flu-like symptoms, fatigue, diarrhea, mouth sores, irritated gums, and my scalp becomes an endless source of dandruff.  I\u2019m still trying to find a way to better manage my symptoms. I\u2019ve already consulted a psychologist  at my university (we call these centers  SSE in France), but most of the advice was things I was already doing. I\u2019m open to exploring other options like therapy, SSEs in France mainly focus on helping students adjust to new environments rather than offering therapy.\n\nI would really appreciate any resources on stress-related physical symptoms or psychosomatic conditions\u2014why they happen, how they affect us, and strategies to manage them. If you think I should consult a specialist, please let me know which type of doctor could help.\n\nNote: So far, I have read Overcoming Anxiety by Helen Kennerly, a self-help book about managing anxiety which was very helpful.",

The only thing that\u2019s ever actually worked, and really quickly, is Betamethasone DP 0.05%. \n\nAs for the anxiety, I have GAD and the only thing that made a significant difference in the physical symptoms were SSRIs.

        "text": "I definitely think you should go and see a doctor again and keep pushing until you get properly listened to. It can be really hard but you have to learn to advocate for yourself with chronic health problems and whilst there will be lots of doctors that dismiss you, once you find the one that takes you seriously and is on your side it can make a huge difference to your treatment. \n\nIf you think a lot of this is because of anxiety then especially given the amount that you\u2019re doing to help yourself it might be worth considering anti depressants. Some help with anxiety as well and this is something a GP can prescribe. \n\nBut I will say, I don\u2019t think this sounds like it\u2019s been given enough attention to say for definite it\u2019s only anxiety. I\u2019m not saying don\u2019t pursue that as a treatment route if only to confirm it is or isn\u2019t that. But do you feel like it\u2019s anxiety or just that this is the only kind of explanation you\u2019ve got at the moment and as drs haven\u2019t found anything that must mean there isn\u2019t anything to be found? Did you feel that the rheumatologist took you seriously? Lots of conditions are exacerbated my anxiety and stress, so it\u2019s still likely this is a component of what\u2019s going on, but with the amount you\u2019re doing to keep yourself relaxed and treatments targeted at the symptoms (but no root causes) to not be seeing much of an improvement seems suspicious to me. The trigger points sounded a lot to me like fibromyalgia, the jaw pain is highly likely to be TMJ issues from night time tooth grinding/clenching - which can happen when we\u2019re dealing with stress or with other pain, the skin issues I\u2019m not sure. Firstly have you been to the dentist? Ask them if they think you grind your teeth (they can normally tell by the patterns of wear although you sound relatively young and I\u2019m not sure how long it takes to show up). They can make you a mouth guard to sleep in that will help reduce those problems. \n\nSecondly I think a rheumatologist is your best bet of the type of doctor to see about this. They\u2019re the people that can look at the big picture and join all the dots together to figure out a diagnosis. There are also basic tests that can be run to rule out certain things like inflammation etc. Did you ever have blood tests done to investigate the situation? If you don\u2019t get taken seriously then you may have to go and see another one again. But a diagnosis of fibromyalgia, or of anxiety being the only cause are ones of exclusion - meaning they have to rule out all other possible causes before it can be attributed to something that has very little testing to confirm. \n\nIt also might be worth keeping a food diary, especially as you mention IBS. Lots of people find they have issues with gluten sensitivity even if they\u2019re not coeliac. But were you ever tested to see if you were coeliac (done by endoscopy)? Because the skin issues and the IBS could definitely be linked to that, or another dietary intolerance like dairy. My wife\u2019s eczema is greatly exacerbated by dairy. Particularly with gluten sensitivity I\u2019ve anecdotally heard people say it causes pain, although I think people usually say joint pain. You can trial eliminating foods to see what difference it makes but try not to limit your diet any more than is absolutely necessary for as little time as is required to find an answer as that\u2019s not healthy. So do it in a controlled way with a food and symptom diary to confirm what difference it\u2019s making (get your baseline for a few weeks first). The FODMAP diet has made a massive difference to my IBS so it might be worth looking at that too. To rule out gut related issues you would need a gastroenterologist and a dietician can help with elimination diets etc.\n\nGood luck",

I am disabled and stay at home, so can usually make the bathroom in time (but I have not made it before & had many near misses). Sometimes there is what appears to be skin and non-digested food in the bowl. Sometimes, rarely, blood & mucus. I also have foul smelling frequent flatulence. \n\nI had a colonoscopy and endoscopy 2.5 years ago, and they didn't really find anything. I got a diagnosis of IBS-D, but no real treatment options or other testing. \n\nSince then I've gotten an inflammatory rheumatic disease diagnosis- Axial Spondyloathritis/Psoriatic Arthritis. I've started a Biologic, Cimzia, recently and am about 2 months into it.\n\nI also have POTS, which I know can cause gastric issues. I find that when I'm really well hydrated I have more gastric motility.\n\nEither way, would it be worth going back to my GI doc? I haven't seen them since the colonoscopy, but I am tired of the belly aches and frequent/urgent diarrhea. Is this just part of IBS-D and I gotta deal with it?",

FODMAPs are short chain carbs that wreak havoc on our guts. Some people aren\u2019t bothered by them but it appears a lot of people with IBS are.\n\nIt\u2019s an elimination diet so it\u2019s not meant to be forever. Just long enough to find your triggers. Some people are insanely sensitive and react to the most minute amounts of triggers whereas others, like me, just have specific foods to avoid. The diet also asks you to go gluten and dairy free because they\u2019re common IBS triggers.\n\nI wasn\u2019t about this at all until I got sick of it and tried it. It\u2019s how I found out that I don\u2019t do well with peas, cauliflower, and dairy. Since cutting those out, a lot of my diarrhea has resolved. Unless I get accidentally dairied that is.\n\nYou do the elimination part first for 4-6 weeks and only eat low FODMAP foods and then slowly reintroduce medium to high FODMAPs to see if you react. Monash University is the leading researcher and they have an app to help. I also bought a year subscription to the Fig app. You set up what your food restrictions are and you can scan grocery items and it\u2019ll tell you if that restriction is in your food.\n\nHope this helps you in the meantime.

A couple years ago my goal was to become the healthiest and strongest person in my life so that I could spend days in the mountains, because up there I don't get over stimulated, happiness doesn't cost money up there, people are either friendly or they stay away.\n\nThen the disability attacked... \ud83d\ude02\n\nGenuinely right now I wish I was up there in the mountains.

Perhaps that sounds easy or reasonable for a lot of people but I have multiple mental illnesses and learning disabilities related to math and spelling, doing math makes me feel physically tired and ill, it by often makes me nauseous. Ironically I'm going to take coding classes and try to get certifications, because to me (with various assists) it's more problem solving than spelling and math, at least the way my brain processes it. I need to find something that pays well enough to one day pay my medical bills and anything needed for accessibility. \n\nBut I feel like this isn't what I want to do. Thinking about it makes me more depressed, anxious, and sometimes ill.

    "text": "Context: 26F, born chronically ill, diagnosed at 25 with Lyme, moderate depression and anxiety, PMDD. Been being treated for a year (after a lifetime of just throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks). I live alone with two cats. \n\nBack in April I was doing well. Probably the best I'd ever been. I was able to go to dance class 2-3x week and my doctors even wanted to start discussing what getting well actually looked like for me. And then...it all got worse. \n\nAfter being prescribed a drug that nullified the effects of my prescribed SSRIs and made me pretty sick, everything went downhill. Currently my blood test (CBC Diff and Comp. Metabolic) are so worrying that my doctor sent me to the ER for anemia. They sent me home without doing anything. The cost of that ER visit will be about the same as treatments I was going to undergo to address atrophy in the left frontal lobe of my brain. Now that's not an option, financially.\n\nI didn't look sick enough for the ER, and my symptoms are only getting worse. I can't eat anything without extreme brain fog and fatigue, so I'm barely eating because I need to work. (I work remotely but I can't be crashing after my lunch break!) I'm so fatigued that I can only stay awake for about 12 hours of my day and have eliminated all non-work things from my life. My life is wake up, work, take care of the cats, sleep, repeat. No dance. No friends. No church. I don't even have the energy for my hobbies. As you can imagine, my depression is the worst it's ever been. Thanks to the anemia and the crying I've been doing daily, my face is raw and my eyes look like they've been blackened.  \n\nI'm also unable to do B12 shots, which was the only solution they could think of in to address my immediate symptoms  because the stress of the needle makes my muscles lock up so much they can't actually do the injection. I'm effectively out of treatment options then, as far as I know, and I don't have the brain capacity and physical energy to figure it out. I'm exhausted and sad and so very very upset that this might be all there is. This isn't a quality of life I can sustain. But it's my only option. ",

    "title": "I switched to a new provider and I think I\u2019m going to cry",
    "text": "I left my old PCP and found a new one. It was really hard to identify why I didn\u2019t like the old PCP, because by all accounts he was a good guy. He was consistent, kind, seemed to listen intently, knowledgeable, and so on. But after three years of no progress I started to feel like he wasn\u2019t taking my concerns seriously. My symptoms only got worse, and my treatment plan floundered. When he left the practice, I decided to leave it as well. The other doctors there weren\u2019t the kind of people I want treating me. \n\nMy new pcp was genuinely kind, not the fake overly sweet kind he was. It was shocking. And she actually listens, responds, and comes up with plans. I told her I have horrible joint pain that old PCP said was just X diagnosis and there\u2019s nothing to be done about it. I asked him about arthritis because my sister and parents have it. He looked at my knuckles and said they weren\u2019t knobbily enough to be arthritic. I told him I was constantly breathless anytime I move, laugh, go outside (seasonal allergies are hell) and was worried that my childhood asthma was returning. He listened to my lungs and said he couldn\u2019t hear any crackling so it was fine and just that I\u2019m overweight. I took his word for it, even though I didn\u2019t feel it was right. When I told my new PCP about these two situations she looked alarmed at his flippant attitude. She said that neither of those situations can be diagnosed or ruled out by physical exam only and that they require tests. \n\nShe immediately ordered the tests - a bunch of blood tests to check for inflammation (for rheumatoid arthritis), and a breathing test for asthma. I went back in a few days later for the asthma test and it came back extremely conclusive that I have some kind of lung restriction. She looked really angry and sad when I told her that I have been dealing with this for over a year and she diagnosed it in less then a week. She ordered and picked up an inhaler from their pharmacy (which happens to be in the same building), and had me try it. I could breathe. Like. Seriously. I could actually fill my lungs. I started tearing up and she hugged me, telling me I was right to be upset that I didn\u2019t get that treatment before. She\u2019s sending me to a specialist to see exactly what kind of condition it is, and the best treatment option. I can\u2019t believe how\u2026 easy it was. I haven\u2019t gotten all of the blood tests back for the arthritis, but they\u2019ve been slowly trickling in and with each one that comes in she messages me the results and her interpretation. It\u2019s so quick. So efficient. My previous pcp took weeks to review tests. \n\nWhen I told her that my previous pcp refused to give me a referral to a gyno she looked confused and asked why he wouldn\u2019t give one. I told her that my symptoms (very irregular periods, painful periods, urinary issues, and so on and so on) were - in his words - \u201cnormal period symptoms and the burden women carry\u201d she looked like she wanted to scream. She said that NO - in fact my symptoms are very abnormal and absolutely warrant a referral and also, that having a vagina is enough of a reason for wanting to see a trained gyno and not \u201csome guy at your pcps office\u201d (her words!!). I was floored. I couldn\u2019t believe how honest and emotional she was about it. She put in the referral then and there, and within a few weeks I was in to see a gynecologist who confirmed that my symptoms are abnormal and that I have PCOS as well as possibly something else. My new pcp was furious that I\u2019ve been dealing with this since childhood, but especially the three years I was seeing him, without any treatment at all. \n\nAnd today - I received a letter in the mail from her stating that she has reported my old PCP to the board of ethics on my behalf. And that if I choose to, I can be involved in the process and give my testimony of the situation. And if I don\u2019t want to be involved that\u2019s my right and they\u2019ll look at my medical record without my name attached. \n\nI want to cry. I\u2019ve never had a doctor who listens and cares like this. \n\nAnd - she even immediately recognized, accepted, and started using my preferred name. I go by a shortened version of my name because I hate my name. When I introduced myself by that shortened name she wrote it on the sheet, started using it, and has been so accepting and cool about it, without me even giving her a reason for why I use it. When she asked me about gender/sexuality (the state has all doctors ask these questions so patients don\u2019t feel invalidated if a doctor doesn\u2019t ask or assumes) I told her that I\u2019m still figuring it out but for now she/her is fine, she nodded, wrote it down, and said to let her know if that ever changes and she\u2019ll update the chart. \n\nLike.. what?? A cool doctor who actually cares and respects you??? It can\u2019t be real. I think I\u2019m dreaming. After the letter today I just can\u2019t stop crying. It\u2019s just so\u2026 validating. ",

He saw a very obviously struggling child dealing with a very obvious genetic abnormality and was like \"Yup, all's well, no support needed\" and thanks to that I now have osteoarthritis. Like, I had no period and the dude was like \"Yeah you're just a late bloomer\". Sir, I am 17!!! \n\nSo when I finally got to a proper doctor it was like my whole world changed. \"Oh yea we did that one blood test and you have hypothyroidism, take this med to fix it. You feel depressed and fatigued? That's linked, should improve with the thyroid meds but we can also give you an antidepressant. Let's also get you an MRI to confirm a diagnosis of septo-optic dysplasia, a condition normally diagnosed as a baby.

She's hilarious and we share the same (kind of morbid) humor, and it's even better because my sister will sometimes just come sit in the room with me while I'm there to hang out, and she gets to do my blood draws whenever she's available too (my sister is the only phlebotomist I know that can get my blood on the first needle stick- she's amazing).\n\nI'm no longer afraid of going to the doctors, or of being judged for asking something I feel is dumb, or that I should be expected to just \"deal with\" like my old PCP made me feel like.\n\nNow my only issue is trying to find insurance so I can actually see her and see the referrals she gave to me! She's so awesome with helping me through not having the insurance either. She'll give me more prescription refills instead of forcing an in-office visit for something I've been on for years (that doesn't require yearly blood-tests or rechecks).\n\nI just can't believe my luck in finding her. It's like having a best friend who's also my doctor, with the awesome side part of having my sister whom I rarely see be a part of it too (barring HIPAA where applicable, of course!)",

My entire lifestyle has been altered by my pain, and I am missing out on so much stuff. \n\nI finally FINALLY had an orthopedic surgeon consult.

    "text": "Ok, please buckle in for this bullshit. \n\nFor some context, I (24F) have been in and out of hospitals (4 times and a total of 50 days in the hospital) for the last 5 months. After a bout of Covid I began to start vomiting and was unable to stop for weeks\u2014 my first hospital stay was a month the total iv fluids and nutrition and a cocktail of multiple iv nausea meds for 30 days and was able to transfer to a series of 4 oral meds every 6 to 8hrs. If I even miss a does I start vomiting and cannot stop\u2014 I also now have no immune system so I keep ending up back in the hospital over and over again. In addition to the nausea and vomiting I somehow tore a number of muscles on my left side from constant violent vomiting spells, and on top of all that I somehow separated a number of rib bones from their cartilage\u2014 this has caused my already horrible chronic pain to become virtually unbearable. I am now on high doses of pain meds that I am currently unable to get off of because every time I get sick I reinjure my body. \n\nWhen i eventually left the hospital, after my first visit, they had no idea why the nausea and vomiting wouldn\u2019t stop and sent me to multiple specialist who think that I have a mix of cushings and a rare disorder triggered by Covid. I also already had gastroperisis prior to the new gi issues, which comes with its own issues.woth all these issues I was basically put on a low fiver low fat diet and avoid any foods that trigger my migraines or can cause any stomach upset. I see a dietician and am getting treated for RFID as I\u2019ve become afraid to eat or drink anything when I\u2019m even a bit nauseated. I also received some pretty bad news last week. I have severe complex migraines and  have been on many  meds that can make you unable to carry a child and if that child is born they will be in the tenth percentile in weight and will likely have birth defects (I also don\u2019t want any human being to have to deal with my chronic issues just because I wanted a child). My partner and parents brought up freezing some eggs as I will need chemo and radiation to treat my tumor causing cushings and there is a definite risk that I would be unable to have kids post chemo. I saw my OB this last week and she made is clear that, because of my medical issues and chronic severe complex migraines, there is no way I would be able to have eggs harvested and frozen (it requires huge doses or hormones and that causes a huge risk for stroke) or give birth naturally as my body doesn\u2019t function enough to keep me alive let alone a child.This all sets that stage for what happened today. \n\nMy brother (M 29) is visiting my parents and me for a few weeks while he can work from home. He arrived Sunday night and I\u2019d been having super intense nausea waves since Friday of last week. I was so sick yesterday I wasn\u2019t able to eat anything and today I came up stairs and was eating some jello when he got back from the gym. Instead of saying hi or anything he comments about how I really shouldn\u2019t be eating jello or any sugar as I\u2019m already fat and need to loose weight. I thought he was joking or something so I just kinda ignored his comment and finished my jello. \n\nAs the day went on I was feeling worse and went to go try and distract myself with some knitting. In my way to get my knitting stuff my dad (who is also a Dr) gave my 3 Powerade freeze pops to try and help with my dehydration and get any nutrients into my body. My brother then felt the need to comment about how if he even had one of those popsicles he would get sick from all the sugar. I told him that my Drs and nutritionist said that these were the best option when I need to get electrolytes and had encouraged me to have as many Powerade popsicles as I wished as I had been functioning on 400-1200 calories a day because of how bad I was feeling and how hard it was for me to eat food when I\u2019m nauseated. Even after I told him this he made a huge deal about how I needed to be on a keto diet like he is so I can lose some weight (I have gained a lot of weight because of Cushings and am working on getting on the right meds and treatment plan to make my body function again\u2014 tbh the weight is the last thing I care about atm as I literally feel like I\u2019m dying). I just disengaged at that point and went to my room until dinner. \n\nAt dinner my mom had made some fish and other foods I can eat and I was so thankful. Once we all sit at the table my brother begins to lecture me about how I don\u2019t eat any healthy foods and that I needed to stop having any sugar and shouldn\u2019t be eating popsicles or jello or soup and should be eating salad and high fiber veggies with meat of some kind for every meal. I was flabbergasted, my mom then tried to explain to him that I can\u2019t do that and that it is good if I get any nutrition down. I then try to explain that it isn\u2019t feasible for me to eat those foods and I can\u2019t eat uncooked veggies, I can\u2019t have pork or beef (they trigger migraines), I can\u2019t have any nuts or legumes, I can\u2019t eat salads or a lot of my favorite veggies as they make me sick now, and I cannot eat high fiber foods. My brother then brings to lecture me about how  my real issue is that I don\u2019t eat right and eat too much sugar and calories. He then proceeded to say that if I really wasn\u2019t getting enough nutrients then I should be thin and not gain weight when I was on IV fluids and nutrition for weeks.\n\nMy dad then attempted to tell my brother that what he is saying is nonsense and hurtful as he doesn\u2019t understand what I\u2019ve been going through. My brother then says that if he ate what I ate he\u2019d feel sick too and that if I ate what he eats I\u2019d recover immediately and lose weight too! My dad told him that he was an idiot and that I shouldn\u2019t listen to anything he says. My brother then became upset and then said that I love to be right even if it\u2019s at the expense of my health. He then proceeded to say that  if I really cared about my health I\u2019d stop taking all my nausea meds and would go on the keto diet and go to the gym with him because proper eating and workouts can apparently cure my chronic illness and chronic pain. This went on for about 20 min and only stopped when I tried to get up from the table, after eating nothing, because I was nauseated and tired of hearing about how I apparently didn\u2019t care about getting better and was choosing to be in intense debilitating pain. As I was turning to leave, my brother decided to bring up my obgyn visit and the recent news that I won\u2019t be able to have any bio kids. He started off by saying that I liked to play the victim and that I do t want to get better. He said I was so stuck on always having to be right about my health and that I was dramatic and a drama queen. He then claimed that my OBGYN had no idea what she was talking about and that my migraine meds I\u2019ve taken in the past (I\u2019ve been on a number of meds that are shown to cause birth weights in the tenth percentile and cause serious birth defects even years after taking the med) and the high stroke risks weren\u2019t real and I was just finding reasons to make myself sick and get attention. And at that I got up, told him he was an asshole, and left. \n\nRight after I was in eye shot my parents started telling him he has no idea what I\u2019m going through and the amount of pain and terror I feel all the time. My dad then began lecturing him on how the human body functions and that getting any nutrients in me is a win. He told them that they were idiots and enabling my bad eating habits. The conversation ended there, and my Dad came and hung out with me in my room and told me to just ignore my brother as he doesn\u2019t understand what is going on. \n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time he as gone on a rant about my weight and what I eat. His obsession with my weight started when I began meeting a number of his close friends over the last couple years. I\u2019ve had issues with food for years. Between not being able to eat food because of migraines, gastrointestinal issues, and needing to force myself to eat even though I threw up after every meal because my body couldn\u2019t digest food I had started to develop a fear of eating because food just kept making me sicker (especially after my most recent bouts in the hospital). Through all this my brother has made a huge deal about how I need to eat less and just have salad and protein and no carbs. At that point in time, because of all my medical issues, I was lucky to be able to eat 1200 and was even luckier if I could keep down 800 calories a day. All that being said it should be no surprise that earlier this year we went on a family trip with some of my dad\u2019s best friends from med school. While we were there every bite of food I took or sip of water I swallowed was commented on by my brother. He would then chime in, infront of my family and my parent\u2019s friends and tell me I should be eating less and needed to skip meals and do more vigorous physical activity to earn my meals so I could lose weight and look prettier. I just tried to ignore it then but I started to just not eat anything, I already never feel hungry because I feel so sick, and I was afraid that when I ate my brother would begin to point out my insecurities. It got to the point where I just wouldn\u2019t eat with him near me and because I was afraid he\u2019d make me feel bad because my medical condition made it virtually impossible to lose weight because my body thinks it\u2019s always starving since I can\u2019t keep food down. \n\nAfter all of this, I\u2019ve become terrified to even open the fridge around my brother. It\u2019s also made worse because I make food for him and my family for lunch most days (it makes me feel like I can do something to help even when I\u2019m super sick) and when I made lunch today and sat down to eat the first thing he said to me was are you sure you should eat that. Maybe you can just have a bite or two or maybe make something a bit smaller than your portion that is low card and high protein and fiber. He also added that if he eat that amount without working out or doing a job that it would be way to much and he\u2019s just skip the meal to eat less calories. \n\nYa, thank you all for listening to my rant. I honestly feel very tired and alone at the moment and I\u2019m also really heart broken as I used to consider my brother as one of my closest friends. Now, I\u2019m starting to feel a lot of resentment and his refusing to listen to me, my parents, and my doctors makes me feel angrier and angrier every time I try to eat around him. \n\ntl;dr my brother keeps making a huge deal about my weight and diet as I\u2019m struggling to keep any food down because of a new chronic condition.\n\n\nUPDATE: I was talking to my mom today after a dr appointment and she told me that she and my dad sat my brother down last night and tried to explain that he is being an asshole and why medically I am doing what I need to do and pushing me on a diet with foods I cannot eat and limiting the calories I\u2019m eating to less the the 400 to 1200 I have a day is insane. He apparently told my parents that they are horrible for \u201cwanting me to have a disease\u201d and \u201cenabling my eating habits, letting me sleep for more then 6-8hrs a night, and not forcing me to go to the gym everyday.\u201d My parents said they kept trying to talk to him and explain that everything he is doing and saying is abusive, but he wouldn\u2019t listen at all and claimed that he knows better then my doctors, dietician, and therapist about what I need and that everyone else was just \u201choping\u201d  for me to be sick. He then claimed that my weight was causing all my problems and then all my pain and symptoms would go away if I started a weight loss drug (which I cannot take because I have gastroperisis and I\u2019m already on 18 different meds and changing anything or starting unnecessary drugs that won\u2019t help and would endanger my life) then I\u2019d lose weight and all my other issues would go away. He also made a big deal about how if I lose weight I\u2019ll need plastic surgery and that fixing my weight and doing procedures if I have excess skin is all we should be worrying about.\n\nAlso later last night I started vomiting again and my dad came down to stay with me and make sure I got electrolytes with some electrolyte popsicles. My brother then came down after he finished his work and started to lecture my dad and I about the dangers of sugar and that if he got sick he wouldn\u2019t eat anything like those electrolyte popsicles because he cares about his body. My dad promptly told his to shut the hell up and got me additional popsicles and had one himself. \n",

    "text": "internally at the verge of breakdown, seems like this is the community that would understand. not sure if anyone would read this, I have sympathetic friends but they would never truly understand.\n\n\nI am (informally) diagnosed with some sort of IBD, maybe crohn's or microscopic colitis. currently no way of knowing since the medical system has just been working against me collectively. but essentially had stomach issues my entire life, and the recent 3.5 years have been debilitating symptoms. as someone in their early 20s, I never experienced such hardship in addition to all the medical gaslighting, I felt my life was ending. I even lost a 10+ year friendship due to her refusal to believe my symptoms. I cant remember the last time I was able to eat a meal like a normal person, not experiencing a whole set of unpleasant symptoms - all for an essential act of survival. \n\non the medical end, I have seen helpful and kind doctors but had so many dismiss me and\nseem like they just want me to suffer. in my country, you must go through a specialist to diagnose chronic conditions, and must wait months to get an appointment. I was eventually seen early 2023, but the doctor did not believe me when I told her my stomach was swelling nearly all the time, and even wrote in a report - patient untruthful, said she had distention but is not. I was put on basically what's expensive laxatives which didn't address my symptoms at all, and extremely unhelpful. eventually I pushed for an endoscopy. following that, she told me results are clear and theres nothing she can do for me further. I thought that specialists were supposed to be the ones that know all the steps to get answers, in fact they are the only ones that can help. but she didn't. as a female doctor, her dismissal of women's symptoms just adds a new layer of sadness to the story.\n\nfurthermore, after an ER visit I got another GI referral. except after multiple calls, I only got the receptionist yelling at me over the phone saying the doctor will not see you, patients who have seen a specialist cannot be referred to another. I explained the last doctor refused to help me. with no one in the country to help me, I went to my home country where the experience wasn't exactly better. despite being really quick, I was told by the doctors that they couldn't find anything significant (despite many signs of strong inflammation) and was told to drink some herbal chinese fluids. not to dismiss the practice, but when something is seriously wrong, actual medical treatment such as drugs that directly address the cause, should be taken. I went to another highly recommended doctor, waited several hours only to have him walk out of the office during the middle of my sentence, and even after explaining I flew 13 hours just to get medical help, he barely listened insisted I just have IBS and stomach sensitivity. when asked what he's prescribing, he just said \"you'll see\". it was a course of $100 probiotics. I disappointedly walked out of the hospital. in the end I had to research and find out which medication at the pharmacy I need to take for IBD, what matched my symptoms the most after months of actual academically conducted research. \n\n\nbut it's maybe the hardest when people closest to me don't understand. I did so much research, ensuring the treatment options were the best for my situation. I had to convince a doctor to prescribe me the correct meds, which is finally about to happen. I didn't sleep all night, knowing I may have the solution now. but I was just notified that one medication is out of stock. I just wanted to rant to my dad, but he asked, did you just decide you need this medication or did you consult a proper GI doctor? knowing everything that happened, and knowing all the people who were supposed to help but failed me, still decided to dismiss/question my decisions. I'm just utterly crushed. I almost cried. even previously, they insisted my problems were caused by me eating vegan. I walked in on my mom berating me in front of the whole family, saying \"she had to join that stupid vegan club at school. nobody else does, why did she\" (does she even know anyone at my school?) and the sheer disrespect just broke me. my dad said, she's your mom, she has the right to talk about you. but it's the concept of respect for another person, not putting them down, and definitely not saying \"my child deserves the pain because she did it to herself\" (???) that doesn't register with them. asian families would understand the pain, which is another can of worms. my parents insisted I need to eat just like them, forcing me to eat when I'm flaring up, and starting fights when I say I'm very nauseous, I cant. they would start saying I'm starving myself.\n\n\nI am still on good terms with my family, unfortunately we can never truly understand each other. I thought about writing complaints about those doctors, but how can that help when it's the system thats wrong? some doctors simply don't care, a complaint or two won't cause them to lose their jobs. I'm not sure if I can fight for a cause to help others like me when I can barely help myself. these past few years, although family and friends tried to be there for me it just causes more stress sometimes. I get very defensive and upset when I get questioned and dismissed like that, like I already have to deal with a chronic illness, why do I also need the emotional pain of people saying, do you really? you just need to eat some regular food I approve of. it's just so tiring.\n\n\n\ud83d\ude2d and another rant, my dad insisted I need to visit an old traditional doc he knows, mandatory. I went, it was mostly tolerable, her saying I'm so skinny and really need to eat (I have unintended weight loss from intestines not able to properly function and absorb nutrients). another random 80+ old lady was there, and I made the mistake of telling them I'm vegan. she blew up, said at least 6 times that I'll die of starvation AND leukemia. she's not a doctor of any kind btw. it was then 15-20 min of them berating my lifestyle, all I could do is smile and nod until my face muscle just couldn't anymore. I was not going to let strangers just reprehend me, I said I needed to go. I know their comments dont matter, but as a highly sensitive person it was just such an unbearable half hour\ud83d\ude2d\n\n\nthank you to anyone who read my rant. I hope you all are surviving through.",

    "text": "So just for some backstory in case you need the full picture: \n\nHey. I am a 29F, I was diagnosed with renal failure when I was 14, and started on hemodialysis (the renal failure was caused by a rare autoimmune disease called P-ANCA vasculitis) I was on hemodialysis for a bit until I switched to PD (peritoneal dialysis) which ended up causing me immense pain due to what\u2019s called \u201cdrain pain\u201d so every daily treatment of PD was excruciating. I finally got lucky and they found a donor when I was 16 (a deceased donor) that kidney transplant lasted me until I was 18 and diagnosed with cancer (lymphoma) I was given 3 months to live, and I somehow survived with chemotherapy and biotherapy and in remission from the cancer.\n\nBut the cancer took my transplanted kidney with it, as I had to stop taking my immune suppressant medication in order to survive the cancer (you take these immune suppressant medicine in order to prevent the kidney from rejecting) \n\nSince I was 19 I have been on hemodialysis consistently. I am on a transplant list, and I have been for a long time. My transplant team told me my chances of finding a match are extremely slim, I even had my sister get tested as we are the same blood type and because my antibodies are so high it didn\u2019t match with hers. The only way to fix the high antibodies is to undergo an expensive and dangerous treatment that insurance doesn\u2019t cover and the treatment is out of the state I\u2019m in.\n\nI have been struggling for a very, very long time. I have lost many access points (like AV fistulas/tunneled catheters) throughout the years as they aren\u2019t supposed to last this long. My last option is to go on PD again since I can no longer do hemodialysis.\n\nI am truly exhausted, I have been fighting this illness my entire life, I am in pain every day and have to take over 28 medications in one day, and I\u2019m so weak, dialysis has brought on other illnesses I won\u2019t get into as this is already extremely long.\n\nBut my main point is this\u2026anyone else out there\u2026 who has been fighting for their life for so long with a chronic illness that has no cure whatsoever (a transplant isn\u2019t even a cure just another form of treatment) \n\nDid any of you or a relative ever make the decision to stop treatment? It\u2019s completely up to me to make that decision, as even my doctors know they are just trying to keep me alive at this point but there\u2019s no way I am going to get better. What helped you come to the conclusion to stop? \n\nI\u2019m aware I\u2019m still young, but you need to remember I have been going through this for 15 years non stop and other organs of mine have already been damaged from long-term dialysis, and I get more diagnoses as the years pass by. My body is breaking down and now my soul is. \n\nI just want some advice, or maybe even a question answered on how someone makes a decision like this. When should I finally throw the towel in? Or do I keep suffering to keep my husband/family/friends happy that I am still around?\n\nA chunk of me believes it\u2019s selfish to give up. I would love some other opinions on that. \n\n\n\nTL;DR: I\u2019m chronically ill (no cure) and trying to decide whether to stop treatment. ",

It's a deeply personal choice. \n\nWhat you can do for your friends/family/husband (and yourself) is control when you go and what you do with the remaining time. That, in some ways, is a gift.\n\nI lost my mom to suicide that was, in large part, because she just couldn't take her chronic health issues anymore. I would have missed her either way, but compared to losing my grandma after her battle with cancer and her choosing to stop treatment? So much more traumatic and painful with my mom because it went from 'okay see you Monday mom!' to 'wait...what...what do you mean she's...'\n\nThey'll miss you, but they'll survive. Grief is rough, but life goes on and wanting to avoid grief shouldn't come at your expense.  \n\nDo you have access to an end-of-life team/therapist/resources? Maybe your medical team can direct you to some resources. They should be able to help you process, then discuss with your loved ones and make a plan.",

Talk to your medical team about the symptoms if you stop treatment, how they can be alleviated, how long it would take you to go and what your options are to medically shorten the process. The latter is something you also discuss with groups that fight for people in your position to have the choice to end their life with dignity. They can tell you about your country's laws, ways around them (in Germany people have gone to the Netherlands with that purpose for years when German laws banned it) etc. Once you have all that information you can decide if you want to end your suffering and how you want to do this. You should not be subjected to a gruesome death if there are better ways to end your suffering.",

    "text": "I just recently joined Reddit and this is my first time posting. I (31F) have struggled with chronic illness for years, but I refuse to accept that I\u2019ll never feel well again. I\u2019m going through a particularly difficult time right now, and I guess I\u2019m hoping to find some advice, encouragement, and hope on here.\n\nI\u2019ve been dealing with depression since 2010, chronic fatigue since 2015, and anxiety since 2017. My depression started after my uncle passed away suddenly and it\u2019s come and gone ever since. It tends to get worse in the winter but can pop up at any time. I was in college from 2011-2016, and that was a pretty good time in my life, but in 2015 I started to develop a host of bothersome symptoms including fatigue and brain fog. I didn\u2019t know it at the time, but I was about a year into an abusive relationship with a narcissist. I started down the road of going to doctors to try to figure out what was wrong with me and spent years doing that. I didn\u2019t make any progress until after I left that relationship (divorced him in 2019/2020) and found a naturopath who was actually willing to dig in and get to bottom of things. \u00a0She diagnosed and treated me for SIBO and multiple chronic viral infections including EBV, CMV, and HHV-6. I saw a lot of improvement with those treatments, and also self-diagnosed myself with histamine intolerance and started following a low histamine diet. I went to therapy and did EMDR, which was really helpful for the relationship trauma, and I felt like I was getting to a much better place. Unfortunately, I feel like these improvements haven\u2019t stuck.\n\nI don\u2019t understand why I\u2019ve made progress at certain times and then slipped backwards at other times, but I know that I still don\u2019t feel the way I want to feel. At this point, I don\u2019t enjoy anything that I used to, I don\u2019t get excited about things, and I have no motivation. I never have any energy, struggle to concentrate and go about my daily tasks, and feel like I\u2019m never really present. I\u2019m constantly miserable and I\u2019m starting to forget what it was like to not feel this way. A couple of weeks ago my depression hit really hard and it seemed to come out of nowhere. The only thing I can think of that could have triggered it (aside from the days getting shorter) were some new probiotics I started trying. I stopped taking them and started to feel a little better, but it was kind of like a wake-up call making me realize that I really need to get serious and do something different to treat my depression. I\u2019ve tried 5 antidepressants and none of them have been a good fit for me. There have been days in the past couple of weeks where it\u2019s been so bad I started looking into psychiatric hospitals I can check myself into, but through my research I also discovered TMS and found a clinic near where I live that does it. I managed to get an appointment within a few days of reaching out to them and I have my first treatment session scheduled for this Wednesday. I\u2019ve been reading up on it and it sound really promising. I REALLY want this to work. I\u2019ve read some encouraging success stories about TMS on Reddit already, but I\u2019m curious to hear if anyone like me with multiple chronic illnesses has done TMS and seen improvement not in only in their depression, but also in their other symptoms as well. Everything is so closely intertwined, at this point I don\u2019t know what\u2019s causing what. I\u2019ve also suffered from terrible insomnia for as long as I can remember and just got diagnosed with sleep apnea this summer. I\u2019ve been using a CPAP for a few months now and I sleep SOOO much better, but I haven\u2019t seen much change in my chronic symptoms like I hoped I would. I\u2019m hoping the benefits will continue to build over time. Is there anything else I should look into or any advice anyone can give as I head down this TMS path hoping that it will work for me?",

    "text": "I stand a chance of physically overcoming or at least successfully managing a decades-long chronic illness with a new medical therapy, that is if I can even afford it. But I feel so mentally battered from the toll of my lifelong battle that I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll be able to adjust to my new reality once I\u2019m healed, if at all.\n\n\u201cA new lease of life\u201d is such a deceptive slogan. Our trysts with illness and disability leave us riddled with PTSD, and it doesn\u2019t stop there. We\u2019re trapped in a purgatory of constant regret over the numerous opportunity costs exacted on all aspects of our lives, from the personal, to the familial, to the romantic, social, professional, financial, and so much more. It hits harder when you\u2019ve always been considered a promising person by the people around you, because you\u2019ll never stop regarding yourself as a failure for not living up to your inherent potential.\n\nThere\u2019s much that has been robbed from me that I\u2019ll never get back after my bodily health has been restored. There\u2019s no escape in my dreams, either \u2013 I am in my dreams as I am in real life, in effect making every sleep a continuation of a real-world nightmare.\n\nThis realization has so thoroughly demoralized me that I\u2019ve stopped working toward my goal of treatment. A part of me feels that it\u2019d be kinder to me and to everyone around me to remain as I am, because a physical recovery would imbue me and them with hope that is potentially false. If I were a teenager, I could maybe get a do-over, but I\u2019m in my late 20s, and there are certain doors that have been shut to me forever. I was eager for a cure, desperate for it, ten years ago; I had to fight my way through the gaslighting of every adult in my life. That anticipation has waned with the passage of time.\n\nI told someone the other day that I feel shell-shocked like a soldier suffering the fallout of battle would, but unlike them, there isn\u2019t an old normal or regular life for me to return to. When you\u2019ve warred with your body your whole life, that is your normal, that becomes a core part of your psyche, if not your entire being. There\u2019s only so much a therapist can do to rebuild you from the ground-up, and I\u2019ve become so cynical and distrusting of medical providers that I doubt any of them will understand the gravity of my situation sufficiently enough to be of actual help.\n\nI guess I'm not asking for help or advice. I just want to feel seen, because we're all in the same boat. As far as I'm concerned, my entire trajectory up until now has been deterministic, and I'm done fighting fate. I no longer care what happens to me.",

It has been life changing for my health and has been the first time in my career where I'm able to be productive and well at the same time.\n\nA new policy has been put into play that requires \"everyone\" to return to the office regardless of a legitimate ADA disability or not. My WFH approval was revoked yesterday by an HR specialist who states that I can be accommodated in an office where i can turn the lights off.  My Dr and I both refuted this with evidence and clearly articulated legitimate limitations supporting why I cannot return to an office. None of my job functions require me to be in an office. I have discovered 2 peers with disabilities experiencing similar treatment.  We are being mandated to work remotely from an office.  \n\nThe strange thing is that my manager moved 900 miles away from the nearest office a few years ago and does not have this mandate. She is telling me that her hands are tied.  Many other managers at different levels have exemption from RTO policy and will continue WFH without disabilities.  This RTO mandate appears to be selective and discriminatory. I am scrambling to find a new job that is remote - its bleak.  \n\n ",

There\u2019s a lot I\u2019ve come to terms with over the last decade and do pretty ok most of the time. I have a diagnosis, a supportive husband and family, and I\u2019m successfully on disability. If that makes you want to skip this post I totally get it, I am so much better off than so many!\n\nMy treatment has gotten more complicated and is negatively affecting my every day life. I learned about a year ago my meds are shutting down my kidneys and eventually my liver. My mental health took a nose dive and I just feel so paralyzed. \n\nI\u2019m medically burnt out. My husband is supportive but definitely avoidant of the realities that I deal with, and I know he avoids it because it\u2019s a horrible reality for him too. Being on a transplant list at 40 to 45 is not ideal, especially since I stop breathing under anesthesia. I\u2019m tempted to stop medication and see if my quality of life is OK enough to survive longer without a surgery like that. \n\nBut my disease gets scary untreated and I could literally lose my mind, especially being one of the worse cases they\u2019ve seen. And that doesn\u2019t even touch on the physical symptoms. For everything going \u201cright\u201d to the outside, the truth on the inside is terrifying and I feel so stuck. And down. \n\nThe ups and downs of this life feels like a nauseating rollercoaster ride that I can never get off of. \n\nI have two kids, 5 and 9, and I constantly feel like I\u2019m falling short. My first triggered my disease (didn\u2019t know that would happen) and my second permanently increased the symptoms (that wasn\u2019t supposed to happen either). This disease is such a mystery it\u2019s like making choices with my eyes closed, even after having it for so long!\n\nToday was a bad day. Lots of pain and digestive problems, and I\u2019m SO annoyed because I just got my medicine a week ago. It\u2019s not supposed to be like this, it feels like I\u2019m sacrificing my kidneys for nothing \ud83d\ude2d Not to mention also finding out that this new drug is becoming less effective for me over time. And it\u2019s probably one of the most advanced treatments out there (dna silencing injection, we\u2019re the guinea pigs). \n\nI guess what I\u2019m saying is, the \u201cchronic\u201d part of our illness must be the hardest part to deal with. The fact that it is *never* going away or being cured, and that hurts my heart. Even after 10 years that hurt sneaks up on you. \n\nIf you\u2019ve read this far, thank you. It\u2019s nice to vent and be heard by people who can relate. \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83e\ude79",

Most health care professionals don't know what it is and almost all of them don't know how to manage or treat it. Getting diagnosed with a rare condition that no one even knows about  can actually be even more frustrating. But its best for you to be referred to your closest crps clinic for further testings and getting on top of it for early intervention.",

    "title": "Chronic Sphenoid Sinus Infection w/ Debilitating Symptoms + A Bad Experience w/ the Canadian Healthcare System - Please Help",
    "text": "Tl;dr I have an atypical but debilitating chronic sphenoid sinus infection. Have had it for almost 4 years now. I am being told that an infection that has been chronic for years is permanent and untreatable. I don\u2019t believe this is true and am looking for advice on how to proceed.\n\nI know parts of this will sound like fiction, but it\u2019s not. Every word is true. And because the story is already long I\u2019m actually omitting many of the most ridiculous parts related to my interactions with the healthcare system. I am a 36 y/o male Canadian. Before this I was highly active and healthy. Well-educated and employed for every day of my life since I was 15. I am not the type who is looking for an excuse to slow down in life. My situation is admittedly unique, but I am in serious need of some advice from the people in this community. I apologize for the length of this post and am grateful to anyone that sticks around to read it. It has been a long journey.\n\nIn June of 2020 I began showing symptoms of an ear infection. This was during COVID, and I was wearing new earbuds 8 hours a day as I sat in Zoom meetings. It\u2019s my guess that this is what caused the infection. The only symptom was a clear water-like discharge. My GP prescribed my 2 courses of Amoxicillin, but the infection did not respond. He said he didn\u2019t know what to do and got me a referral to an ENT. It was an 8 month wait. At the time I didn\u2019t think much of it. The infection just wasn\u2019t bothering me much and at the time I didn\u2019t have any medical knowledge. I didn\u2019t think to request a culture or a different kind of antibiotic.  \n  \nIn November of 2020 I had some intense ear pain, followed by tinnitus (still with me today). I went to the ER, but was just told I had a perforated ear drum, it was an inner ear infection and that it would go away. About a week after that I began getting symptoms that made me very very ill. At first it was just more symptoms consistent with an ear infection. ETD, balance issues etc. But then I began getting intense sinus pressure, dizziness, nausea, chills and hot flashes, malaise and fatigue etc. Watery eyes. Pain in the neck. This constant soreness and swelling sort of above the soft pallet. Then I began having neurological issues. Weakness, constant muscle-spasms all over my body, weird changes to my vision. Issues with bowel function and sexual performance. Peripheral neuropathy etc. My heart was constantly working like it was in the fight of its life.\n\nI went to the doctors and they focused intensely on the neurological symptoms. I was given a prescription of Amoxicillin again but when nothing improved after taking it they concluded that it was not an infection. In retrospect, this was insane given that this very clearly started with an ear infection, I had a perforated drum, tinnitus and would later learn I have some ETD due to scar tissue developing in my Eustachian tube.\n\nAnyways, my symptoms stabilized but I never really got better. I was basically bed-ridden for 2 years with all of the symptoms matching the description an infection in the sphenoid sinuses, but with strong systemic symptoms of a bad infection that made productive living virtually impossible. A culture was taken from my ear, but by this point there was no more discharge, only debris from the infection. It showed gram-negative bacteria (this is important) I then felt better for a year, with the exception of the damage to my ear and muscle spasms everywhere, which appear to be permanent. Then in June of this year I got sick again.\n\nI won\u2019t get in to all the issues along the way (like doctors not reading the reports), but I did have some imaging tests done. The timing of all these were terrible, somehow taking place on days or weeks when my symptoms were light. Mostly brain CTs and MRI\u2019s as for years the doctors were convinced I had a brain tumor, ALS or MS. But my first MRI (a year after the onset of symptoms) showed indications of infection all over the place. In my ear, sphenoid sinuses and right mastoid. I had an MRI which showed a retention cyst in my sphenoid sinus. More recently, a CT scan showed numerous polyps had formed in my sphenoid sinuses and there was some mucosal thickening. There was also calcification of the ligaments in my neck from all the inflammation. I got in to see an ENT who dismissed my symptoms as headaches. She said the CT showed no active infection.\n\nI have had bloodwork on a bunch of occasions. All clean.  \n  \nI got so sick in July of this year that I went to the ER again. This time I was prescribed Levofloxacin, and it made me feel indescribably better. So much better that it was impossible to conclude it was a coincidence. But, several days after finishing the course I began to get sick again. Nevertheless this was the point where I began to really become convinced that what I was experiencing was that same ear infection from years ago. I learned that Levofloxin is a much broader-based antibiotic and targets many gram-negative bacteria that Amoxicillin does not. The doctors dismissed it, saying it may be the anti-inflammatory effects. I was prescribed prednisone but overall it didn\u2019t give me relief. I was then given another course of Levoflox as a test. I felt 100% better taking it again, but got sick again when it was done.\n\nI tried a saline rinse with Pulmicort mixed into it and used the \u201chead to ceiling\u201d method to hit my sphenoid sinuses. My symptoms reacted strongly. Though not in a good way. My systemic symptoms got better, but my local symptoms (dizziness, sinus pressure, rock-in-head) got worse over the course of days. Then when I quit the rinse I got very very ill.\n\nFinally, after all of this, I saw an internist who diagnosed me with a chronic bacterial infection. She said that it\u2019s probably under a biofilm and is well-contained by my immune system which is why it isn\u2019t showing up on bloodwork or directly on imaging. She believes my immune system is responding strongly because clearly I had a terrible if not life-threatening infection a few years ago that gave me brain or nervous system damage.  \n  \nNow here\u2019s the kicker, and why I want your advice. She told me that it is not treatable. That when an infection is this chronic you are stuck with it for life. She said to pay attention to my symptoms to see if it is spreading to my brain or heart, but because I am not terminal, there is no \u201cclinical justification\u201d for intervention. She said the biofilm will prevent a proper culture and antibiotics won\u2019t be effective. I think we\u2019re all presuming it is in the sphenoid sinuses. I was told to prepare myself as best I can for a life of disability.\n\nI tried going to other doctors, who are unfortunately dismissive. I tried getting another referral to an ENT, but was told that because the first one diagnosed as headaches that another one would just read that note and do the same. I can\u2019t get a referral to an infectious disease specialist. I\u2019m told it\u2019s simply out of reach in Canada unless you have HIV or sepsis or something more systemic.\n\nThis is absolutely insane. My experience with this is not the standard sinus infection. It is debilitating. My body is under tremendous stress and I am virtually bed-ridden. Probably in part because of how hard my immune system is working to contain the infection, and the fact that the initial infection was so dangerous and widespread. That year of relief I experienced was characterized as a dormant period. I describe it as having the worst flu of your life, every day for years. It just can\u2019t be that I am being told to live as a disabled person at 36. I have a wife and kids. People who are dependent on me, and they have tried virtually nothing to date. Just the 10 day course of Levoflox. No cultures, no other antibiotics, no biofilm disruptors etc.\n\nIn short, I have a chronic sphenoid sinus infection but it is an a typical infection with atypical origins. What can I do to help, or tell me doctor? I was thinking of asking for liquid antibiotics. Something that targets gram-negative bacteria, and delivering it through a saline rinse. Neither I nor my family can bear this suffering much longer and if a chronic infection really can\u2019t be treated, I need to know. Obviously I would prefer to find relief in Canada, but money is no issue and I would go anywhere in the world and do anything to find treatment. Any tips?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",

    "text": "Hey all, new here!\n\nFor some background, I\u2019m undiagnosed but currently seeking treatment for stomach problems, joint and muscle problems and severe brain fog and fatigue. I\u2019m also suspected autistic. \n\nI just got confronted by my partner of 6 years about how I\u2019ve been making her feel like I don\u2019t want to spend any time with her because I\u2019m always so tired. I feel crushed. I am so sad to hear how I\u2019ve been negatively affecting her, I feel like a horrible partner, like I\u2019ve failed and let her down and that maybe we\u2019re incompatible because of this. I\u2019ve been struggling since around the time we started dating and it\u2019s only gotten worse with no answers as the years have passed. \n\nI feel like this is a layered problem, yes I am tired all the time, I never get enough sleep, daily things take me more energy. I also think this is compounded by the fact that my partner isn\u2019t working (short term disability due to ableism about her adhd at previous job) and has been feeling like she\u2019s losing friends and doesn\u2019t get out as much without me anymore. I also have pretty bad anxiety so going out can be a challenge even on higher energy days. I feel kinda blindsided, I thought our time just laying around together and talking or watching something was nice and good but she said we never do anything together and we never hang out so I guess that doesn\u2019t count to her. \n\nI think she had some valid points and I do need to try harder to not just default so the same comfort activities and at least suggest something that might be more her speed (complicated games like magic the gathering, league, ark etc.) she loves to think and I love to rest. I want to find ways to make more time for her but she thinks I\u2019m being unrealistic, that this is all I have to give and she needs to just be okay with it, I feel so guilty and don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair to her. \n\nIf anyone else has been through something similar, hearing how you accommodate both parties would be greatly appreciated. I tried to google some ideas of how to do more but all the resources seem to be about how to care for the sick one. I want to fix this issue before it grows into resentment and causes bigger problems ",

    "text": "I had the ultimate crushing blow of an experience this past weekend when when my friend\u2019s 8 year old son told me to STFU about my illness. It was awful. I had dragged my tired, pained ass to a pumpkin farm with my dear, old and supportive friend and her kid, because I love them and I don\u2019t have many people left in my life and it means so much that she makes an effort to include me in her kids\u2019 lives despite the fact that I\u2019m\u2026 well, I\u2019m chronically ill and everything that comes with it (although I like to think I\u2019m kind, funny, and I try hard to be a good friend, too\u2026) \n\nAnyway we\u2019d been at it for hours, between the car ride and various activities\u2026 I was REALLY starting to wilt, but I\u2019d brought extra meds to prop me up and I was trying SO hard to make this outing fun. We\u2019d talked for hours already and had kind of run out of small talk. Neither my friend nor her kid were making conversation, so I finally started in about something pertaining to my illness, which I hadn\u2019t talked about other than reminding my friend that I couldn\u2019t walk as fast as she was going a few times (and the anecdote was a doozy too - the fact that my mom hadn\u2019t bothered to respond to my text when I told her my new methotrexate was making me lose my hair and I was scared, and how upset it made me).\n\nAll of a sudden, mid-sentence, my friend\u2019s son (who I very much love and for what it\u2019s worth is REALLY smart - like a little genius so I don\u2019t know what he hears/thinks\u2026.. I just have always assumed that if my friend is okay talking about a subject in front of him than it must be okay???) says \u201c\u2026.can you stop talking about being sick? It makes everyone feel bad.\u201d\n\n*Pardon me while I get kicked in the stomach.*\n\nI don\u2019t quite remember what my friend said. I think she said \u201cyou don\u2019t have to listen if you don\u2019t want to,\u201d but it was clear from the way she reacted that she felt the same way. She didn\u2019t disagree with him. \n\nNext she launched into a story about how her 90 year old grandma was trying to cc her on emails to doctors and pull her into helping with her medical care and how little she cared, and how she wished her grandmother would leave her alone because she wasn\u2019t interested.\n\nMessage received.\n\nWe were on the hay wagon thing back to the other side of the farm and I was staring down at least another hour of pumpkin farm \u201cfun,\u201d and an hour drive home.\n\nAnyway I had been out in the hot sun for hours and I was in pain and I was EXHAUSTED. And I was trying not to cry. My friend says \u201care you okay?\u201d \u201cHm? Me? Fine!\u201d I say. \n\n*As I\u2019m dying inside.*\n\nThe rest of the outing was torture. I felt like I was going to die, physically and emotionally, and all I could think was \u201cplease just let me get home so that I can cry.\u201d\n\nWhen we pulled into her driveway I was supposed to have come inside to see her other son (long story) but I was barely holding it together. I was SO tired and hurting and needed to cry really bad. I was at the point where I figured \u201cI have chronic illness. They\u2019re used to me letting them down. And if not, then I guess I just lost my last friend because I CAN\u2019T do this.\u201d (Also my new immunosuppressants make me sensitive to the direct sunlight we\u2019d been in ALL DAY LONG).\n\nI said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m so tired and I\u2019m in so much pain\u2026.. I have to get home and lay down.\u201d And told her how much fun I\u2019d had and how glad I was she\u2019d invited me (half true, and true) and just\u2026.. got in my car and sped home as fast as I could. I figured she\u2019s my last friend standing with this chronic illness stuff and I might\u2019ve just burned that bridge by bailing like that but I\u2019d hit the wall. Even if the comment from her son hadn\u2019t destroyed me, I was hanging on by a thread.\n\nButt the comment from her son HAD destroyed me.\n\nAnd I just couldn\u2019t do it. I summoned everything I had for this outing. I\u2019m taking new immunosuppressants that make me feel like I have the flu. So I took extra other \u201cbooster\u201d meds just to get through it because it was IMPORTANT. \n\nAnd I tried for hours not to talk about being sick. I talked about EVERYthing else. But we apparently ran out of conversation and this is ostensibly my best, oldest friend and when I finally broke down and brought up something about my life, it was me trying to pour my heart out about something that was as gut wrenching as my mom not giving a shit if I lost my hair from my treatment. \n\nAnd I know he\u2019s just a kid and I\u2019m NOT mad but I AM *something* about being interrupted by this small voice and learning that even this little eight year old boy wants me to STFU about my illness aka my life. \n\nIt was\u2026. It was awful. And then I had to pretend to be okay when I felt like shit and I\u2019d just gotten stabbed in the heart. \n\nI swear, I\u2019m NOT mad. He\u2019s a kid. Kids say things. Their brains work differently. It\u2019s fine. I\u2019m not mad or anything. I\u2019m just\u2026.. it HURT. It did. It hurt. And I felt embarrassed and ashamed. \n\nIt was awful. All that and I\u2019m still wiped out. And some other bad stuff happened. And I hate being sick. I hate this life. I hate that even though my entire life revolves around being sick, I made conversation about ANYthing BUT being sick for like three hours. And the moment I even mention what\u2019s been going on in my life lately, I get interrupted by a little kid who politely asks me to change the subject.\n\nBecause NO ONE wants to hear about it.\n\n\ud83d\ude22",

I experienced something similar when I went on a cruise with my friends as a teen. I had been sick for like 6 months to a year, and I told myself I\u2019d regret not going (I had said yes to it prior to becoming chronically ill). I ended up being in terrible pain the whole time, pushing myself too hard, and not having my friends understand what I was going through. Ever since then, I\u2019ve mainly only agreed to low-key activities or meet ups with all friends so I don\u2019t disappoint them, which in turn makes me feel like crap",

I was born immunocompromised and have been taking experimental meds since I was a baby. I just spent over a decade in an incredibly high pressure and high stress industry. All of it combined, plus a severe mold exposure that lasted 4 years because it took me a while to figure it out, absolutely crashed my health and broke my nervous system and I am now super environmentally sensitive. I just spent 2 months in a home in Portland, where the air is extremely triggering for me, and the home was incredibly bad for me; the residents say there\u2019s no mold but my body and nervous system really did not handle it well at all. My fatigue and brain fog have been so bad I\u2019ve been unable to think straight or walk more than a block. And my nervous system is completely fucked right now; I spent a week uncontrollably crying for no apparent reason, unable to function, and I still get small crying jags. I have thought about checking myself into a mental hospital but I\u2019m scared I\u2019ll have a worse reaction to any antipsychotics or sedatives they want to give me and I\u2019m not sure it would help.\n\nI used to be a successful journalist and had to quit my six figure dream job because of my health. I figured removing myself from my moldy apartment and stressful job would help. It\u2019s been over a year and I am still sick. Over the past 5 years I\u2019ve spent over $100K on treatments, docs, tests and supplements and I am rapidly running out of money.\n\nI\u2019m trying to start freelancing but my brain fog is making it really difficult to do the only thing I am skilled at, write. I get easily confused and lost and overwhelmed when I\u2019m writing now. I have no clue how I\u2019m going to make enough money to take care of myself.\n\nI am 33, soon to be 34, single, and feel like my time is running out to find a husband and to have a child. I would not bring a child into the world with my body being as sick as it is and with me being so unstable; it would be cruel and hurtful to raise a little human while I\u2019m like this, even if I did have a husband. I don\u2019t trust that I will ever find someone my age who has a career and is willing to put up with my issues.\n\nI work really hard to keep my mindset positive and give thanks regularly for the level of functionality I do have and the miracle that I live largely without pain and with the full use of my body. I pray a lot. I still have faith I can heal. But I feel completely lost. I feel like even if I regain my health somehow and figure this out, my life is irreparably broken, the life I worked so hard to build is gone, my time to achieve the things I want is running out, and I can\u2019t see a future in which I am not lonely and broke or doing a job I don\u2019t enjoy. \n\nThe funny thing is, I\u2019ve had way worse depression than this\u2026this doesn\u2019t even feel like depression compared to where I\u2019ve been at the worst of my illness. I\u2019m not suicidal. I still have the energy to keep trying and still want to. I am just feeling so scared and so alone and so lost. I have been taking it a day at a time for years now and somehow made it through a lot. I know I am making slow and small progress. But even if I heal, what will be left?

We've been friends for about 35 years, I've only been sick for 17).\nI actually blogged this recently (on my blog about me/cfs, lorem ipsum life) [linky](https://loremipsumlife.wordpress.com/2023/03/07/who-am-i-now/)\nIt's hard not to feel depressed about life when you're basically sitting around waiting for time to pass you by. I'm learning about Buddhism, mostly Zen, at the moment because it seems to have a nice approach that works with that grief and the pointlessness feeling.",

    "text": "So it\u2019s kind of a long story but I\u2019m not the more eloquent writer so I\u2019ll just try and make it as brief as possible. I have officially been diagnosed with cerebellar ataxia due to Hashimoto thyroiditis. \n\nIn late summer of 2019 (I\u2019m 30 at this point), I had just moved to a new state and within 6 days of being there, I woke up one morning with trembling in my left hand and had difficulty opening my contact case. I thought I must\u2019ve slept on it wrong and pinched a nerve or something. It wasn\u2019t until later in the day when I was trying to write out a birthday card that I noticed my handwriting was off and it seemed to take way more concentration than necessary to write it out. \n\nFast forward to that night and I tell my husband that I\u2019m going to just go to the ER to get checked out because I was feeling really odd and slightly uncoordinated in my hands. I drove to the ER less than 4 miles from out house and when I go to check in, I feel like I gave difficulty walking and trying to write down all my info is just awful, most of it illegible. A nurse comes over to talk to me and now my speech is slurred and I\u2019m having aphasia so they rush me back thinking I\u2019m having a stroke or something. \n\nThey run some basic neurological tests and I fail the finger to nose and the heel to shin. I\u2019m freaking out at this point because it\u2019s terrifying to try and move your heel down your leg and pretty much see your leg just going crazy and not doing what you\u2019re asking it to do. They admit me and do an MRI. It\u2019s midnight at this point so I call my husband and tell him I\u2019m not coming home. He\u2019s asleep and doesn\u2019t get my message until the next day. \n\nI stayed in the hospital for 3 days while they do a slew of blood tests, MRI, spinal tap, etc. My bloodwork looks pretty normal, low bilirubin and high TSH (not too surprising because at this point, I\u2019ve been on synthroid for 6 years to what I was told was hypothyroidism). My MRI came back fine, nothing of concern to them. \u201cThere is a small susceptibility artifact at the right side of the pons\u201d was basically the only thing that showed up. CSF was normal. They released me with a psych referral and neurology referral. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I got home that I really looked through my discharge papers. They thought I was crazy and making the whole thing up. My speech would still scan and I had to really concentrate on what I was saying. I\u2019m a fairly fast talker so this was driving me crazy. Calling up the neurologist to schedule a followup appointment was torture. I had trouble getting what I wanted to say out but the nurse was the best. I spoke to my mom on the phone after and you could just hear the worry in her voice. She wanted to come down and check on me because she knew something was wrong. \n\nI ended up meeting with the neurologist a week after my discharge and I will never forget him. From the start, he took me seriously and from my symptoms and how I was presenting, he knew it was something cerebral. My appointment that day was 2 hours long as he performed a neurological exam and got my history. I was slow to talk and had some difficulty with movement but he knew I wasn\u2019t making this up and I was scared because I didn\u2019t know what was going on with my body. I would randomly just start to cry as well and I didn\u2019t even realize until he handed me tissues. \n\nLeaving the office that day, I felt so much better even though we still didn\u2019t know anything yet. He request all the blood tests (I had 13 vials drawn the next morning as some were fasting) and I did an eeg  and he put in for authorization for genetic testing. \n\nOnce the lab work came back, it was then we discovered my FANA stain was positive with both homogeneous and speckled patterning and my thyroperoxidase ab levels were 314. The high end of normal range is 34. This was the first time I ever had my thyroid antibodies checked and with the level being so high and the FANA stain coming back positive, he diagnosed me with hashimoto thyroiditis and said I most likely had another autoimmune disorder as well but wasn\u2019t sure which one. \n\nHe didn\u2019t want to start out with a super aggressive treatment plan but wasn\u2019t quite sure how to treat my ataxia. Thinking it was possibly an encephalitis, he put me on a 2 week dose of a medrol dose pack to see if that would help. Holy shit! After taking the 6 pills at once to start the loading dose, I felt better! I was able to have better control of my hands and my speech wasn\u2019t as slurred. I still had difficulty with \u201cM\u201d words (of course my youngest brought home a book called my mommy is a mummy and wanted me to read it \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f). \n\nWhen I started weaning off the steroids, my symptoms would return but I was ecstatic that whatever this was seemed treatable and something was working! When I wasn\u2019t on steroids, I couldn\u2019t lift things over my head without my equilibrium being thrown off. I couldn\u2019t ride a scooter or bike because my brain didn\u2019t think I was in control and I would just wobble around and end up crashing. \n\nI was on medrol 4 times between sep-dec 2019 and after that, I was like nothing happened. I was pretty much back to my normal me. I was in \u201cremission\u201d and my neurologist was presently surprised. Then Covid came along\u2026 I thankfully didn\u2019t catch it but once they came out with the vaccine, my endocrinologist and neurologist suggested I get it due to being immunocompromised. I got bit and was fine until 2 weeks after my final vaccine, I noticed I was shaky while walking with my coffee cup into the living room. \n\nI made an appt with my neurologist and by the time I saw him, most of my symptoms were back. I couldn\u2019t do the finger to nose test, had a slight tremor in my hand and had some scanning speech. More blood tests and more steroids. We finally were able to piece together that when my thyroperoxidase ab levels are high, my symptoms become worse. I was on steroids from June 2021-April 2022 because they were the only thing that helped me get back to normal. \n\nAfter fighting with insurance for almost a year to cover IVIG treatments (it was considered experimental for my condition) I was blessed to have a kind benefactor who covered my initial treatment and when that actually worked, my insurance now covers it. I get monthly infusions and I\u2019m so grateful that they work because I feel so much better than I did on steroids and I don\u2019t have to worry about the long term effects steroids can have. Being in them for as long as I was already destroyed all the enamel on my teeth. \n\nSorry this was super long and I left out a bunch other day to day stuff too but I was wondering if anyone else has a treatable form of ataxia too and how it\u2019s affected your day to day life.",

    "text": "I have a chronic illness that has made school very difficult for me. It is undiagnosed and autoimmune so I am sick all the time. I am in my last year of my degree and have one semester to go before I graduate. The problem is, I got Covid over the summer and now I have long Covid. My health is terrible and I am currently failing classes. I am hopefully going to get extensions so I don\u2019t fail any classes, but my goal has always been to go to medical school so my gpa is important to me. I am starting to wonder if this is a career I will even be capable of, health-wise.\nI have exams starting next week and should be able to get by with this semester, but my next/final semester starts in January and I don\u2019t know what to do. I want to graduate so I can work while I take some time off and get my health back on track before maybe one day applying to medical school. I could still work without graduating but I am so close the end of my degree and the pay raise would be really beneficial, especially with health insurance ending if I\u2019m not in school anymore. (I am in Canada tho so insurance only would be needed for prescriptions and some experimental long Covid treatments). My partners job doesn\u2019t have insurance either. \nBasically, I don\u2019t know if I should take my classes next semester and get more sick and exhausted from the stress, then graduate and rest for a few months while working from home, or if I should drop out after this semester and get my health back on track faster but not have my degree or health insurance. I have taken time off school before for my chronic illness and I just want to be done with my degree and not drag it out any longer. I also have student loans taken out for this year and I don\u2019t know how dropping out would affect that either.\n\nIs it worth it to just stick it out and graduate?",

(Who knows \u2014 maybe they offer services like someone who goes to class with you and takes notes for you.) \n\n- You know those \u201cgoing to school naked\u201d dreams?

Every single time I\u2019ve had one of those dreams, when I wake up I have to remind myself that I graduated. My graduation was normal. Nothing about my school experience itself creates this nightmare. And lemme tell ya, when I remember that I have my degree, the relief is huge. The relief isn\u2019t that the dream isn\u2019t real \u2014 it\u2019s that I\u2019m done with that crazy part of life. \n\n- I think most schools let you retake a class to replace a bad grade. (This is not a perfect solution \u2014 but it IS a way to see this as less black and white.) \n\n- Is there any reason you can\u2019t go part-time? \n\n- Is there any reason you can\u2019t think of it as a semester off instead of stopping and maybe you\u2019ll go back someday?",

I would recommend talking to your advisor, the enrollment office, financial aid, and your insurance to see if you can take a semester off, rather than dropping your program altogether. This could give you the time you need to try to get in with your doctors and get the treatment and rest you need to better tackle your final classes.\n\nKeep in mind, this is all your decision. If you end up deciding the best course of action is leaving your program and finding a job that you could do that provides insurance until you feel ready to go back and finish, don't feel guilty about that. Do what's best for you in the *now*, because if you try to push through and end up in a worse situation, that's not going to help the future you, either.",

    "text": "**if you\u2019re someone who, like me, is in a rough spot with romance and CI, maybe don\u2019t read this**\nI\u2019m 26f and this is my first post here. I have a wonderful girlfriend, we\u2019ll have been together 4 years this month. We\u2019ve lived together for 3 years. When we met, I was a completely healthy person working a physically demanding job 60+ hours a week. Multiple weekly social events. We\u2019d go on dates and trips in different cities and go camping. Really active. Two years ago, I caught a severe antibiotic resistant disease that almost killed me. I spent weeks in the hospital during covid, some time in the ICU, and after 5 failed rounds of treatment, we had to fly across the country to get an experimental treatment to finally put me into remission. Words can not express how incredibly she handled my illness. She was my full-time caregiver when I was bedbound for months, while getting her masters and doing an internship. \n\nFinally in remission, I thought things would start getting better. And don\u2019t get me wrong, anything is better than how sick I was before. But I don\u2019t think I even got back to 50% of how I functioned before. Lingering chronic pain, exhaustion, deconditioning from months of severe malnutrition and minimal movement. I still can\u2019t work. Most days I don\u2019t feel up to leaving the house. I tried to be patient with myself, but over the last few months things have been getting progressively worse instead of better. And I\u2019m sitting on about $50,000 of medical debt so going to a specialist felt\u2026both unattainable and scary. This week my new symptoms finally got bad enough to get me into the doctor. To make a long story shorter - all signs point to me having a lifelong autoimmune/thyroid disease. \n\nI\u2019m of course really really upset. I\u2019m excited for the possibilities of getting treatment and finally feeling better but like\u2026this was never part of the plan, you know? And I know I should be worrying about my health and taking care of myself but all I can think about is my poor girlfriend. \n\nThis is a woman who is full of more life than anyone else I\u2019ve ever met. Literally. She has this endless energy. Down to do anything whenever. Always on the move, extremely social, really active. And our first two years were incredible but I feel like I\u2019ve stolen the last two years of her life from her. I\u2019m a great girlfriend, like a really great girlfriend. I\u2019m loving kind caring giving romantic thoughtful etc etc etc but none of that could possibly make up for what she\u2019s lost bc of me. No I\u2019ve never told her she can\u2019t do the things she wants to do but she\u2019s an amazing partner who doesn\u2019t want to leave me alone when I\u2019m extremely sick, and on top of that if you\u2019re an adventurous active person, you want to do these things WITH your partner, not alone and knowing they\u2019re stuck home in bed. I can see it affecting her. We are about to do something huge - going to Europe to visit her grandmother for a month. And now it looks like I\u2019m going to get this diagnosis days before going and from what I\u2019m reading, it takes MONTHS of treatment before you start feeling better from this illness. Am I going to have to spend this entire trip in the same state I\u2019ve been and possibly getting worse? I feel like I\u2019m torturing her. There are moments that I want to sit her down and tell her she can leave if she wants to. I don\u2019t want to hold her back anymore. She\u2019s such a beautiful bright human being and I hate dulling that light with my sickness. I love her so much and I know how much she loves me but it feels so unfair to be this constant financial mental and physical burden. I\u2019ve wanted to marry this woman since the day I met her but now I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d want to put her through that. I know it\u2019s not my fault. But that doesn\u2019t really do anything to help. Ugh. Sorry for the super long post. I just needed to get this off my chest.",

He met me while I was recovering andearning how to manage my life all over again. He's the light of my life and my absolute rock, and I spent years hating myself for thinking I was stealing time from him.\n\nAnd then he got sick. Really sick. And I nearly lost him. And then it no longer mattered how bad I felt, or how bad he felt, as long as we were together. We helped each other through some really bad days, and I held him when his meds gave him bad side effects and just prayed to anyone listening to just give me one more day, one more hour, one more minute.\n\nA full year (and so many medical bills) later, he's at 100% again, and back to being my loving and full of life partner. And I think about that year almost every day, I watch for any symptoms of that illness that nearly stole him from me and I get it.\n\nOur partners see us as being stolen from. They see the sickness as a separate entity from us. We watch each other for signs of discomfort, and while I can't always sooth him (which frustrates me), he knows my heart and shows me how to support him in the best way that I can despite my own setbacks.\n\nTalk to her. It is so clear how much you love her, and it seems like she's just as devoted just by your words.\n\nYou are not your sickness. If she has a brain, she'll see that too. You are a person with a lifetime of experiences (that sound incredible), and this is not the end of your life, or hers. It's a new journey, albeit a frustrating and hard one. Sometimes love means choosing that person over and over, and over circumstances that might hold you back as a person.\n\nI'm sorry this is happening to you. I'm sorry you feel like you are taking your wonderful partner's life away from her. But she chose you. Open yourself to the idea that she continues to choose you over something that happened to you. You aren't stealing from her, she is choosing you and choosing to carve out a new life with you, come what may.\n\nI'm sorry, my dear. If I could, I'd wrap my weak arms around you in my strongest hold. You are more than your sickness, more than your body.\n\n(Also, sorry for the long comment. My heart just goes out to people like us. We don't deserve it, but we do deserve love.)",

        "text": "Speaking as the healthy partner, I truly believe an open honest conversation about this is healthy. \n\nI met my wife almost 8 yrs ago.  We have been married 6 yrs and she was diagnosed just over 4 yrs ago.  This is a 2nd marriage for both of us.  I work full time and in my time off, I chose to spend it with her.  We have discussed the same basic concerns you are posting.  She used to work full time. We traveled around the country. Took vacation trips for Pokemon Go in Chicago or Star Wars in Anaheim or Orlando.  We took our 4 dogs on hikes in the mountains at least weekly.  And now there are extreme limits on what we can do with her current health. She used to cook all these amazing meals, now we do primarily takeout.  I know that this is all very difficult on her, mentally, emotionally & physically due to stress increasing her flares.  As I have said in my comments on other posts, I recognize that she isn't her diagnosis and do my best to remind her that I'm here for her & we will deal with it together.  \n\nPersonally, I don't have any desire to go out with friends at the moment because I know that she's already been sitting at home all week just trying to hold onto her sanity due to the physical limitations of her health.  I can't enjoy myself knowing that she is dealing with so much.  My heart breaks knowing I can only do so much to actually help.  \n\nTo me, this is part of the whole concept of a relationship. It's not all strawberry wine and rose petals in a hotel room on a lazy Sunday afternoon. \n\nBesides, I really like her, ya' know.",

    "text": "I just felt so guilty. Besides having fibromyalgia since late 2007, and having only two pain-free days since then (only because I was on high doses of prednisone due to a really bad allergic reaction to something,) I also have a benign tumor (plantar fibromatosis) in the fascia of my left foot, which makes extended walking painful. I got an experimental laser treatment done and it seems to be working, but extreeeemelyyyy slooooowlyyyy, and there\u2019s no way to predict how far I\u2019ll recover, if it\u2019ll come back, etc.\n\nLife is complicated because my various medical issues require me to be on a strictly gluten-free, low-carb, low fiber, low-spice, high animal protein diet. We have to be so careful where we go out to eat, he tries so hard to find new places but it\u2019s very frustrating, especially because we live in the Southwest US and there\u2019s a lot of Mexican food here. (And yes I\u2019m sitting down this week and starting to make calls all over town to find new places where we can both eat.)\n\nThen there\u2019s my real first world problem: I grew up with travel-crazy parents, and by the time I was 45 the only continent I was missing was Africa. My husband (aka no. 3, aka The Keeper) had never really been anywhere except Mexico by the time we met in 2006. We went to Paris for our honeymoon in 2007, and did so much walking that that\u2019s where my first round of bad foot issues started. I improved just enough for us to be able to do some other really great trips, but on our agenda was always India, Africa and Australia, as well as the UK, and we\u2019ve always said we would both really love to go back to France to see my French exchange family again (I\u2019ve been involved with the family one way or another since 1968.)\n\nGiven my current health status, it may not even be worth it to plan for anything in Europe or the UK, let alone Australia. The other issue is that I\u2019ve been diagnosed with some pretty severe medical sensitivities, which means I should never get another vaccination unless it\u2019s absolutely medically required\u2014in other words no India or Africa. (I\u2019ve been to India twice, I know people there who I would love to see one last time, and I have no problem with most of the food there, so it would have been awesome to be able to go back, and of course Africa is my only missing continent so I really wanted to get there as well - *huge* bucket list item.)\n\nMy sweetie is bummed. *Really* bummed. We met before I got fibro and this stupid tumor, when I could go anywhere and eat anything, so I feel like he got sucked into a situation that suddenly made a 180\u00b0 turn. He\u2019s 66 and doesn\u2019t feel like he\u2019s got a lot of time left to do trips like that, even though he\u2019s disgustingly healthy; he doesn\u2019t want to go without me but doesn\u2019t want to miss out either, and although I really want him to be able to have those amazing experiences before it\u2019s too late, I would have some feelings about him going without me.\n\nAnd don\u2019t get me started on what the complete lack of sex has put us both through.\n\nIt just sucks. Thank god he\u2019s a saint and loves me like crazy and will never leave me, and he only leaks frustration on extremely rare occasions, but the other day it just got to be too much.",

    "title": "Canadians/N. Americans: Need Advice on Moving to Ontario with Complex Medical & Medication Needs. (Long Post).",
    "text": "**TL;DR:**\n\nI\u2019m a Canadian permanent resident living in Norway with a complex medical condition requiring specific medications. Financial strain and isolation mean I need to move to Ontario for family support, but Canadian healthcare restrictions on narcotics and GP shortages make this challenging. *Please read the full post for a complete understanding as it\u2019s a complex case. I need advice/solutions\u2014please share any insights/ ideas rather than just sharing how bad the system is or that I shouldn\u2019t move. :( Your time is much appreciated.\n\n**Full Post:**\n\nHello everyone,\n\nI\u2019ve been living alone in Norway for the past 6-7 years and have found Norway\u2019s welfare system functional, though not perfect. I moved to Oslo in 2017-2018, and by 2020, my health started declining. Last year, my condition worsened, and I became bedridden. I managed to work full-time until my August 2023 surgery, after which my health deteriorated further. Unable to manage alone, I went to Canada for Medical Assistance in Dying (MAiD) approval, as I am a Canadian permanent resident.\n\nThe main reason I\u2019ve stayed in Norway this long is due to sickness benefits, which covered my salary for a year. Unfortunately, my employer unfairly terminated me due to my illness, and while I sued for severance, I still lost out on sick pay after the 11-month mark since I didn\u2019t have an employer afterwards. I recently applied for work assessment allowance, but was denied, and it would take 7+ years to qualify for permanent disability. Now, without income or a support system, staying in Norway is unsustainable, even though the welfare system has helped me immensely otherwise. \n\nIn Norway, I\u2019ve been able to establish trust with my doctors and receive the treatments I need, including various medications that manage my pain. My condition, largely related to Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS), has required extensive and complex treatment since a lot of severe complications, including an entire damaged pelvis arose from it. I even temporarily turned down an extremely expensive surgery for my specific condition, offered by the top specialist in Switzerland through the Norwegian government, due to the risk of worsening my condition. My current medications include:\n\n**Daily Medications:**\n\n\t\u2022\tOxycodon3 (Immediate-release, 10mg, 2-3 times a day)\n\t\u2022\tParacet@mol (4 times a day) \n\t\u2022\tOx@zepam (25mg, 3 times a day) \n\t\u2022\tBaclof3n XR (25mg, 3 times a day)\n\t\u2022\tAmbien (10-20mg, once at night) \n\t\u2022\tElv@nse for ADHD and to counter sedation (30+30 morning and evening) \n\n**For Breakthrough Pain / Emergency Use:**\n\n\t\u2022\tMorphine injections (10mg) delivered by a home nurse\n\t\u2022\tFentanyl patches (50-75mcg)\n\t\u2022\tOxyContin (20mg)\n\t\u2022\tValium (10mg)\n\t\u2022\tChlonazepam (2mg)\n\t\u2022\tClonidine\n\t\u2022\tAdditional non-narcotic medications\n       \u2022    Buprenorphine patches 50mg \n\n* I don\u2019t usually take the second list at all, except for chlonidine to knock myself out.*\n\nMy specialist wanted me to try Levo-methadone next, as they\u2019re aware of my history of not picking up medications from the pharmacy, my aversion to opioids due to their side effects, and their limited effectiveness at times. The pain clinic noted in my records that I didn\u2019t want an increase in my opioid dose, so they couldn\u2019t assist further.\n\nI take just enough oxycodone to manage symptoms (twice a day)\u2014keeping my laxatives effective, reducing the intense burning in my pelvis and feet, etc. Although they recommended 20-30 mg of oxycodone, I refused that amount. Overall, I appreciate Norway\u2019s relatively functional medical system.\n\nMy family lives in Ontario, Canada. Despite the need for support, I didn\u2019t previously attempt to move there because my brother was concerned about the quality of care in Canada compared to Norway, where ER services and doctors have been supportive. As my condition worsened, they never denied my referrals or even fast tracked it. I also have private healthcare insurance, so when public queues are long, I can see the same doctors privately, though this does come with its own challenges.\n\nOverall, Norwegian specialists never accused me of addiction as I\u2019ve always gained their trust by not mixed meds, or picking up meds from pharmacy, or being extremely anxious of taking opioids all alone due to low pulse rate and BP. So they have given me the necessary medications after numerous trials and finding limited efficacy in other options. I have refused increased doses, wanting only enough relief to manage daily pain and side effects. Atm, Oxy is the only opioid that works if taken in moderation (2x a day). If I increase its loses its effectiveness. \n\nAs my condition worsened, they never denied my referrals or even fast tracked it. Tried giving me an inpatient ket@mine trial too, but it didn\u2019t work. I also have private healthcare insurance, so when public queues are long, I can see the same doctors privately. \n\n**Why I Want to Move to Canada:**\n\nThe Norwegian system, though supportive, cannot provide me a support system even though they do have some schemes, but it\u2019s not the same as what family can do for you. At this point, I want to live with my family who can help me with daily tasks like cooking, eating, errands, love, care and support. However, my brother fears I won\u2019t get a GP in Ontario due to the shortage and long wait times. He\u2019s been trying to informally talk to GPs he knows, but they\u2019ve all told him that I need to come and register for OHIP and after looking at my lengthy records, they can answer that question. \n\nOHIP informed me that I must register for health insurance and apply for a GP, but during the wait (which can last for roughly a year), I can only be out of Canada for a month. The biggest hurdle is that Canadian customs limits schedule 2 narcotics to a one-month supply, even for terminal patients. The person I spoke to at customs was blunt and unhelpful, and OHIP couldn\u2019t provide alternative options and said \u201cwhen you run out of meds, you can do what the rest of the Canadians do. Go to the ER and hope for the best\u201d. Walk-in clinics don\u2019t prescribe narcotics, and the ER is notoriously slow and inefficient as most Canadians can vouch for. \n\nWithout access to medications, I can\u2019t survive, let alone work remotely to support myself and keep myself busy. *My Norwegian doctors are even willing to prescribe a six-month supply to ease my transition and write a detailed letter of my situation, something almost unheard of here due to the possibility of drug abuse and selling drugs on the street, but Canadian customs still restrict it and said even if you\u2019re dying, we can\u2019t let you in with narcotics for more than a month.* my doctors suggested they could adjust dosages on the labels to extend usage, but I\u2019m not sure how long those would last. Maybe two more months, but not more. \n\n**Questions for Ontario Residents:**\n\n\t1.\tDoes anyone know of a GP in Ontario who is accepting patients, is understanding and might continue my prescriptions while collaborating with my Norwegian doctors?\n\t2.\tIs there a faster way to get a GP given my complex medical needs?\n\t3.\tWill I need to redo my medical assessments for complex diagnoses in Canada, wait for years (the luxury of time that I might not have) to get referrals and dismissed, or would my Norwegian and European records suffice?\n\t4.\tIs there any way to legally bring in more than a one-month supply of my essential medications during this transition? Maybe through the US, like keep it at a trusted friend\u2019s place in NY and bring it every month? \n\t\n**Questions for US residents/citizens, especially New York:**\n\n\u2022 Would the American doctor, specialist or clinic, no matter how expensive that might be, serve as an option for continuity of care to a non-US resident/citizen? I have been to NY to see a specialist name he prescribed me diazepam for suppositories for 3 months. My partner went to Mayo Clinic, Cleveland and other famous hospitals in 2017 when he had a complex spinal condition (still does) and they prescribed him all the opioids under the sun. However, my US friends from support forums tell me that it\u2019s extremely hard to get access to opioids, even for them who are in palliative level care. Only a few people lucked out, but they go to doctors that I might not be able to see as a foreigner since they only accept insurance patients, I assume. I have another doctor in Arizona who was willing to prescribe *an* that I wanted to try, but he said I\u2019d have to travel all the way to Arizona, otherwise he license might get confiscated. Does anyone have recommendations within the US healthcare system while I find decent doctors in Canada?\n\nI always have the option to travel back to Norway for new assessments, or prescriptions to try, but I can only do this like twice in a year. \n\nI can\u2019t stay in Norway due to financial, social, and other challenges, and I need my family\u2019s support. I\u2019d deeply appreciate any insights from those familiar with Ontario\u2019s healthcare or anyone who has faced similar challenges. **Thank you so much** for taking the time to read this \u2013 understanding the full scope of my situation is crucial, as it\u2019s highly complex and nuanced.\n",

    "text": "I don't even know where to start. My life plummeted into a downward spiral and I feel like I'm in a nightmare that I'll never wake up from. This is an extremely long post, so I don't expect that many will read it. But I'm hoping to get some personal comfort from the catharsis of putting this nightmare into words instead of holding it inside.\n\n**TL:DR**\n\nI experienced extreme pain (level 10) down my cervical and lumbar spine and had to go to A&E. I got hospitalized while the orthopedic doctors investigated my spine with x-rays and a MRI. Eventually, I was diagnosed with cervical spondylosis which triggered a slipped disc. I'm now in constant pain, fear and helplessness. The doctor said I would be better in 3 months once the slipped disc heals but I'm worried that my life will never be the same again, and that I'm in for a life of chronic pain. It's hard trying to accept that I have a degenerative disease with no cure. \n\nI'm not coping well, but I'm trying to be brave. Any encouragement would really, really be appreciated.\n\n  \nThe rest of my post is just me detailing all the things that brought me here. Feel free to skip. \n\n----------------------------------\n\n**Events leading up**\n\nI am an avid gamer and crocheter. So, I did the stupid thing where I gamed for hours and hours after FFXIV's newest expansion launched. This lasted for a month. The second month, I decided to take a break from the game and prepare to rent a stall for a crafter's charity event with my friend. This resulted in me crocheting like a fiend for 1 month straight. 6 to 8 hours a day, with short breaks for lunch. And of course, I ended up in a shrimp-like posture while bent over the table.\n\nMy nightmare first manifested in the form of thumb tendonitis that quickly led to tennis elbow on my right side. Losing the ability to use my right hand properly was horrible and I had to compensate with my clumsy left hand. I couldn't sleep because of the pain, and often flipped and turned, sometimes even pushing myself off my pillow with my neck in frustration because I couldn't utilize my elbows properly. I'd also toss and turn, and contort myself into strange positions to try and fall asleep. Eventually, this led to a week of an extremely sedentary state where I spent most of my time on my recliner because there was nothing I could really do without severely triggering the pain in my elbow. Somewhere along the way, my neck started to ache, and my trapezius muscles kept bunching up.\n\nSo there you have it. A series of bad decisions and mistakes, and even at this point, I thought my tennis elbow was my greatest physical trial. What an idiot I was.\n\n----------------------------------  \n  \n**The beginning of my nightmare**\n\n\n\n**Oct 1** - Then, it happened. Last Tuesday, I fell asleep with relative ease compared to other days. I remember thanking God so profusely as I drifted off to sleep because I just felt so peaceful and comfortable. I fell asleep on my right side. Hours later, I half woke up and decided to change positions so I wouldn't put too much pressure on my tennis elbow. So I turned on my back, didn't like how that felt, and turned again to lie on my left side. Immediately, this HORRIBLE pain resonated at the back of my neck (L4 - L5 region) and I jumped out of bed, yelping in pain. It was at least a 6 to 7 on the pain scale. I immediately ran for a cold compress. Eventually, the pain lessened to a 2 and I decided to try going back to sleep. Nope. The moment I lay down, the pain started escalating again and I had to get up.\n\n\n\n**Oct 2** - I went for a neck x-ray the next day and found out that I had mild cervical kyphosis and some wear and tear in the L5-L6 region where they had been compressed to the point where there was very little space in-between. I thought it was the kyphosis that was causing the pain. I started googling methods of stretches that could relieve kyphosis, such as chin tucks. Through all this, my neck hurt like crazy so I had to stop and I decided to get a physio referral the next day.\n\n\n\nNight fell, and it was horrible. I couldn't lie down at all. I spent the night trying to lie down, finding out that I couldn't, getting up and doing a hot compress to see if it would help. I took 2 anarex. It barely dampened the pain. It was a full night of fear and pain. Eventually, I think my body shut down and I managed to fall asleep for 45 minutes before the pain woke me up again. I think it was the longest night in my existence.\n\n\n\n**Oct 3** - I went to the doctor to get a referral for physiotherapy. She took a look at my x-ray and proclaimed, \"this is not a normal neck.\" And basically made the situation sound so horrible that I really just felt so hopeless. She asked if I had done a lumbar spine x-ray and said that she wouldn't be surprised if there was damage there as well. After a full night of insomnia and pain, this really just triggered my depression. I did get the physio consult, and for a blessing, it was on the same day.\n\n\n\nAt the physio session, the therapist actually assured me that the kyphosis wasn't actually some life altering thing, and that some wear and tear in the cervical spine was normal and could be handled with some stretches. I felt very comforted and left the clinic feeling more hopeful, even though my neck was still at a constant level 2 to 3 of pain.\n\n\n\nThe thing is: I have a tendency to pain catastrophize. This happened throughout my tennis elbow incident so I thought the neck pain was the same thing. I think I basically gas lit myself into thinking that I was exaggerating the amount of pain I was feeling and that if I didn't think about it, the pain would go away.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n**Hospitalization**\n\n\n\n**Oct 3 Midnight** - I decided that this amount of pain wasn't normal. By this point, I had not slept since the night the neck pain first woke me. After trying to lie down and discovering that every position caused the neck pain to escalate, I decided to go to the A&E. I thought that I'd just have the doctor check me out and give me some peace of mind.\n\nOn the way to the hospital, the painkillers I took wore off. I'm not sure if it was a combination of being jostled during the ride, but the pain in my neck started escalating and radiating down my spine to my back and tailbone, and over my collarbone. I dug my nails into my skin while gasping in pain. By the time we reached A&E, I could barely walk because I was trembling in the most extreme pain I had ever felt. It was beyond a 10 on the pain scale. My blood pressure was at 160 and rising and they immediately wheeled me into critical care. I begged for painkillers while tugging at my hair. Eventually, they gave me every painkiller that wasn't morphine and I slowly felt my panic dissipate as I fell into a drugged out state. It was like my body had become a shell and I was trapped inside. But through all this, the pain fell to an 8 and I could feel it. But I couldn't respond to it. It was horrible.\n\n  \n**Oct 4** Eventually, they told me that I had to be warded for observation. I felt relieved, honestly. I thought the doctors would find out what was wrong with me, they'd fix me and this pain will go away. And I'll be okay.\n\nThus began my stay in the hospital. The lead doctor came by and told me that they thought two things were the cause of my pain. Firstly, he suspected a trapped nerve caused by the lack of space between C5-C6 and / or a herniated disc. They arranged for more x-rays of my lumbar spine and a MRI for both my cervical and lumbar spine. I was put on pretty strong painkillers and that helped me to finally fall asleep.\n\n\n\n**Oct 5** The hospital's physiotherapist came by and taught me some neck exercises. I was asked to do some basic things like looking to the left, right, up and down. I could do all this with a decent range of motion, but it really triggered the pain. Eventually, she asked me to look up and hold the position for 20 counts. This caused me so much pain that I had to stop. I think she eventually realized that I wasn't ready for physiotherapy yet and told me not to do the stretches if they caused pain.\n\nI was quite afraid at this point. I had been told that physiotherapy would be a key thing to improving my situation. But it hurt so badly. I tried to comfort myself, thinking that perhaps the pain was currently at the acute stage and I needed to let it heal a little.\n\n\n\n**Oct 7** The day of my MRI scan arrived. I was terrified because at this point, even with the painkillers, I could barely lie on my back for a minute before the pain got too much to bear. How would I survive 1 hour in the MRI machine?? My mental health at this point was at a all-time low and I had spent the past few nights just sobbing in fear.\n\nOne of the nurses caught me crying and I think she must have said something to the doctor because the lead doctor came by hours before my MRI. I told him about my trepidation and uncertainty if I could lie on my back throughout the MRI scan. He decided to give me a shot of pethidine just so I could get through the scan. And it actually worked. I ended up completely inebriated and actually started humming and singing because the world started going up and down. I think I slightly scandalized the MRI techs because I kept asking if I had to remove my bra and panties, and kept trying to show them that my bra had no metal underwire or clasps.\n\n^(.... I decided never to do narcotics henceforth. \\^\\^''')\n\nBut I did appreciate that little bit of humor and levity. I ended up sleeping through the MRI scan and when they pulled me out, I utterly refused to let go of the panic button. One of the techs had to gently prise it from my grasp. I was so out of it, but it actually felt nice because the fear was temporarily lifted.\n\nThat night, back at the ward, was by far my favorite one. The effects of the pethidine were still in effect, but the vertigo went away so I was just left with this delicious sense of levity and good humor for a couple of hours. I actually felt normal again, just slightly tipsy but in a really good way.\n\n-------------------------------\n\n\n\n**The diagnosis**\n\n\n\n**Oct 8** - I was awakened by the junior doctors around 8am. I was actually excited to hear what plans they had to help fix my situation. Finally, they knew what was happening and they would help me.\n\nThis is what the female doctor said:\n\n>\"Yeah, so the results are out. What you have is spondylosis. You know what that is? The degeneration of the spine? Yeah. You have that. Are you ready to be discharged today?\"\n\nI literally felt my world collapse around me. Even as my panic built, she mercilessly just continued and told me to inform the nurses if I wanted to be discharged so they could process it and they left. And that was it.\n\nNo help. No hope. I would never be the same again. That was all I could think about in that moment.\n\nI went into full panic mode and frantically pressed the call button. I didn't even know what to do but I knew that I couldn't be alone. A nurse came in and immediately asked me what was wrong. I told her what the doctor said and she started to reassure me that there could be ways to live with this, and that I wouldn't be in perpetual pain. She calmed me down and promised she would try to get the doctors to come back.\n\nFinally, the lead doctor came by, with the junior doctors in tow. I was barely holding back tears, and to his credit, he sat down and asked me what he could do for me in such a patient and gentle voice. I asked him if this pain was something that I had to live with for the rest of my life, to which he went, \"No!\" He then told me that the cause of such extreme pain was a herniated disc, probably due to the compression between my C5 and C6. He assured me that the inflammation would subside and the pain would dissipate within 3 months. I then continued to tearfully asked about my spondylosis and whether I was doomed to a life of pain. He said that my condition could be maintained with physical stretches and exercise once the pain from my herniated disc heals. I did have to make some lifestyle changes (no more hunching over my desk like a shrimp for long hours, no high impact exercises) and I had to wear a soft cervical collar to prevent myself from looking down.\n\nI asked if I had to sleep in a certain way, and he assured me that if I was going to injure myself further, it would be while I was awake and not while I was asleep. He knew I had been battling some insane insomnia during the pain, and told me that I should just find whatever position was comfortable so that I could sleep, and my body could heal. I told him about my suicide ideation because of the sleepless nights full of pain and he swiftly told me, \"No no no. Don't think like that. It's like a car has a punctured tire and instead of just changing the tire, you scrap the whole car. No. You will get better.\" Then he told me he would write up a psych referral to help deal with my depression.\n\n------------------------------------  \n\n\n**Where I am now**\n\nI'm not sure if he was saying all that to be kind, and that my condition is actually more serious. But right now, I'm just taking things one day at a time and trying to stay positive. It's my second day of being discharged from the hospital. I'm at home, and it feels surreal. Everything in my house is the same. But I'm not. I'm afraid of the future. I'm afraid of not being able to ever carry and cuddle my beloved dog again. I'm afraid that I took my life and health for granted, and this is my body's way of punishing me. I'm afraid that I will never be able to travel again, or even to go to my favorite shopping mall. I'm regretting all the trips that I never took, all the times I should have exercised, but was lazy and chose to be sedentary.\n\nI really want a second chance to live normally again. But I don't know if it's possible. I guess I'll have a better idea once the pain from my herniated disc subsides this time.\n\nI'm highly traumatized, especially from the sleepless nights filled with pain, and the excruciating night at A&E. I don't really know how to work through this trauma. I'm trying to just stay positive, to accept and lean on the support and love that my loved ones are offering me. But I do feel so very much alone in this. I'm honestly envious of them and their lack of degeneration in their spine. I do keep asking - why me? I think I'm experiencing the stages of grief and mourning my old life and self. Because I don't think anything will ever be the same again.\n\nI had a good life, up to this point. A really good one. And I'll miss it. But for the sake of the ones who love me, and for my own sake, I'm going to try and be brave. I'll rest and recover, and when I'm in a state of lesser pain, I'll work hard at physiotherapy, maybe get a personal trainer to help teach me exercises that I can do to strengthen my core and build some muscles to protect my spine.\n\nI think. There's a good life, a full life for me, even with cervical spondylosis. I have to believe that.\n\nIt's just really hard right now. And I'm so scared.",

If your pain is nerve related, an SNRI(cymbalta, etc.), TCA, or anticonvulsant(Lyrica, gabapentin) could be something to maybe try and be easier to get. I have some weird undiagnosed testicle pain and doing pelvic floor therapy, and Cymbalta and Lyrica have provided some relief but not enough unfortunately. Could just be something to try in the mean time. I know how hard it is. Too many visits and being referred to other specialists and going in circles.\n\nI would research complex pelvic pain specialists in your area and see what you can find. In my experience, a lot of pain clinics have little experience with pelvic pain or simply don\u2019t treat it. It\u2019s a grossly under researched and undertreated problem. I haven\u2019t got there yet unfortunately but you may just have to find that one doctor who\u2019s actually willing to do a deep dive on your issue and get you the help that you need.

        "text": "I don't have a recommendation for a pain md in that area, I'm sorry.\n\nA couple of things:\n\nFirst, I'm recently finding that it seems there are specialists in pelvic pain and they might reside in urogynecology, not in standard pain mgmt practices.  These people aren't even that well known to the pain management clinics I've tried.  These clinics will say \"pelvic floor therapy?\" or \"have you talked to your gynecologist\" and maybe if that person is a PCP they might not know about this specialty either ... so I figured I'd mention it.\n\nI could see that maybe a pain mgmt practice could have one of those specialists on staff. However, in my experience (5 clinics so far maybe?), pain mgmt practitioners that one might encounter in a hospital's \"pain clinic\" seem to have only spotty knowledge of this area.  The ones I've met have been more coming from a background of general anesthesiology or neurology, and seem to be most solid in the areas of arthritis / spine / limb neuropathy / CRPS and stuff like that.  Anything to do with the specifics of the uro or the genitals and a lot of them are somewhat lost.\n\nSecond, as it happens, I met with a urogynecology pelvic pain MD today in my area, and I mentioned the TENS treatment for neurogenic (spasming) bladder.  She knew of it.  I've been using it to relax muscles in my deep gluteal but it's used for bladder, and for spasming in other areas.  All these areas are served by nerves that come from the sacral plexus, which is apparently why it works for all of them.\n\nI just looked it up and it seems to be a treatment for IC, too.  Here are a couple of links showing at least some promising results.  I've read other links that give much higher response rates for some issues for structures served by these nerves, I mean above 75% success.  \\[edit: and it might be possible that it's that successful for IC, too.  There is some indication that anecdotal reports are stronger than what research has been able to pin down\\].  And of course the TENS electrodes are totally non-invasive.  As long as one doesn't have a syndrome that rules out their use, like fibrillation or epilepsy, of course.  But I use mine on and off throughout the day and even to fall asleep, and I have seen research showing that that's fine too.\n\n[https://www.ic-network.com/interstitial-cystitis-treatments/neuromodulation/](https://www.ic-network.com/interstitial-cystitis-treatments/neuromodulation/)\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1476001/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1476001/)\n\nHere's a comment I made a while back talking about the method, and there is a link in there to an imgur album with pictures of my ankle with the electrode pad placement marked.

    "text": "Hi there!  I've been smoking cannabis on and off since around the age of 14 and I'm now heading swiftly towards hitting 44, so a good part of 30 years.  I didn't touch anything from 2018 to 2021 as the company I worked for did random drugs testing. (I worked on the roads for A Plant LUX as a cone fairy). Anyway .. in 2020 pre lockdown, I had an accident which triggered a load of underlying problems to crawl out from under the rocks.  To cut a long story short, I now have several chronic conditions and a total of around 16 ailments.\n\nI decided to start smoking cannabis again to help with the pain.  I didn't use any opioids from the Dr as I don't like how I feel on them and they're addictive.\n\nI found out that you could legally get cannabis oil and flower on private prescription from ten different specialist clinics, as part of the \"UK's clinical trials for medical cannabis\".\n\nI use a special \"Dry herb vaporiser\" to take my medication.  I have a travel one as well as two mains powered ones.  All three are made by Storz & Bickel.  They aren't cheap and neither is my prescription, if I'm honest!\n  I use my PIP to pay for my medication bill of \u00a3420pcm.  This gets me 40g of flowers at 24%THC  <1CBD, then 30ml of cannabis oil at 20%THC 10%CBD. Both from Curaleaf clinic.\n\nAnd yet... Because \"weed\" has such a bad name and having massive misinformation & propaganda spread around.  I sometimes get people passing comment in public if they catch a whiff.  I know that they may not know it's me, but I could do without hearing \"don't people know it's illegal?!\" or \"It's a bit early in the day for that!\" \"There's kids over there and people with families\"... Yeah, I'm a person with a family just trying to discreetly live my life, lol.\n\nIf the doctor said to some of these people \"I can offer you two choices, either a medical vape that you load with Cannabis throughout the day, or a shot of Morphine twice a day?\". They would choose the Morphine, the most addictive and closest related to Heroin that you can get via the NHS. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\n\nDoes anyone else get made to feel awkward for taking medication, especially prescribed cannabis?",

    "text": "I feel so angry even as I\u2019m writing this. My pain management clinic since I\u2019ve been with them already under treats my pain because of the whole \u201copiates are bad\u201d campaign and it\u2019s super funny how so many other people are on them there but for me ohhh nooo can\u2019t correctly treat my pain. \n\nI was finally making some headway; I came from Kaiser being on 40 mg total of norco per day 10 mg basically every 4-5 hours. Kaiser cut me off for no reason all because I kept trying to push to please try cortisone shots. I am not and have never been an addict just severe pain from my herniated disc, degenerative disc disease, spinal stenosis all in the l4-l5/s1 etc. It took me over a month from switching from Kaiser last year to get into this pain clinic. The first thing was they would only give me tramadol, not great but better than ibprofuen. \n\nI switched through like 4 other doctors within the pain clinic because they have multiple locations and one is super close to my house, but after literally all others acting like I was drug seeking, I went back to the first doctor who prescribed the tramadol and told him I only didn\u2019t come back immediately because of the drive being further and I was hoping some of the doctors by my house would be good. \n\nWell anyways after 6 months and a new mri showing the herniation getting huge, he was like yeah I definitely believe you\u2019re in pain. And he wanted to try RFA since the cortisone injections didn\u2019t help. And he switch the tramadol. To 2 5 mg norco per day. And I don\u2019t want to seem like a drug seeker so I was like but DAMN that\u2019s still barely anything. I don\u2019t expect to get back to 40 mg but 2 10s per day would probably control my pain at least by the end of the day when it\u2019s at its absolute worse. \n\nI got by barely while we tried the diagnostics still in severe pain most of the time. The two diagnostic trial for the RFA actually seemed to work. Like I didn\u2019t feel any pain for the rest of the day of procedure for the first time, and I would not have felt pain the second time because the good doctor from that clinic also said that since we know the first one \u201cworked\u201d he didn\u2019t want me to feel pain and so on top of concious sedation he gave me fentanyl. Again for like the entire day i felt great until it wore off. \n\nSince the procedure itself two weeks ago, I\u2019ve been in severe pain. Also my good pain doctor left the clinic so I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen this month on the 23rd. But I\u2019ve been super suffering and they keep telling me give it time up to 3 weeks but now I have no hope this helped at all and I\u2019m in serious regret like my worst pain most days hovers around 8-9 and I\u2019m at 10 every day since the procedure. And they\u2019re not taking me seriously when I leave messages. I\u2019m not having a fever/signs of infection at the injection site so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s infection. \n\nI hate everything. Also last month right before he left he refilled my medicine and they were out of 5s at the pharmacy so they called me back and said the pharmacy had 10s and I was so hopeful since I talked about my bad pain they\u2019d give me 2 of those per day. Nope. It\u2019s the same amount prior just in one pill. I fucking hate all of them, how is it fair i don\u2019t get my pain treated and other people get all the pain meds they need. Im so bitter. Why am i not as deserving of pain relief? ",

    "text": "I'm 24. I lost my insurance a year or two ago and moved to another state with equally shitty, if not worse, free healthcare options. I just want to rant about the state of things because life feels fucking impossible right now. No advice please, but if you have a similar story, please feel free to share it.\n\nPrior to losing insurance, I was being evaluated and treated for:\n\n* Constant back, neck, and shoulder pain caused, at least in part, by hypermobility and small, constant muscle spasms\n* My joints painfully popping and feeling as if they were sliding out of place\n* Asthma\n* Assumed Vocal Cord Dysfunction due to previous testing from an ENT who told me the required testing would be extensive, but that that was the dx that best fit the symptoms in his opinion (but no treatment for this, it just should be on the record somewhere)\n* Racing heart\n* Lightheadedness\n* Weight gain not explained by lifestyle choices\n* Insomnia\n* Anxiety\n* ADHD\n\nI was in the process of getting an official autism diagnosis, and had already received testing from my therapist, who agreed with the dx. I had also \\*finally\\* found a therapist I really, really clicked with. I was in physical therapy up to 3x a week. I was also about to see a cardiologist (about my heart) and a neurosurgeon (about my spine). And then I lost my insurance.\n\nI have been on Medicaid my whole life. Medicaid is the reason I had access to healthcare at all. At some point they changed the criteria to exclude young, able-bodied adults who made less than the earning requirements, but they ignored many cases who had already been approved. Eventually, they decided to finally go through all those cases, and I was a part of the many who got booted from the system with no warning. I'm still shocked and so thankful I managed to get my wisdom teeth removed before losing my insurance. If I ever find out it wasn't covered somehow and that bill ever comes back to me, I would have literally no means to pay it whatsoever.\n\nI am very invested in my health, but without insurance, I have no means to take care of it anymore.\n\nSince losing insurance, I have done a TON of research and have had a lot of pieces fall into place so that I am \\*fairly\\* confident I know what is going on, or at least what ballparks to be searching in. But no insurance means no chance at even attempting to get diagnosis.\n\nI don't and can't work. I apply to every position I think I could force myself to tolerate, particularly if they offer insurance, but I never hear anything. And if I'm being honest, I know I can't really handle any of the positions I apply for at this particular stage in my health journey anyway.\n\nI am dealing with subluxations daily. My neck is currently either subluxed or bulging or pinching a nerve, I can't tell you exactly, but I can tell you that it feels like one wrong move would paralyze me.\n\nThis is an injury I sustained from literally just laying my neck on a foam roller. \\*NOT rolling my neck on it.\\* Just laying on it. I genuinely thought I was going to have to be lifted off the floor and taken to the ER that night. I still don't know how I managed to peel myself off the floor and get to bed. This injury felt like it was healing, and when it finally got to a point where I couldn't really feel it anymore, I yawned and stretched one morning and reactivated it.\n\nI literally get injured from stretching. From laying on foam rollers. From sleeping. I am a very strong person! I used to weightlift, and I currently really want a pull-up bar and weights to use at home. But my bones \\*will not\\* hold themselves together correctly, so unless I am incredibly slow and mindful about my movements, I \\*will\\* injure myself.\n\nSo, I'm well aware at this point that the government doesn't care if I end up homeless and die. I'm lucky to be living with a partner who financially supports me, but they and their family still need me to work, and so I'm still trying to find it. Plus, without access to healthcare, I have no means to explain why I feel so awful all the time, so no one understands. Labels might not be the world, but they do grant you access to a level of understanding you don't have otherwise, and that goes for trying to get others to understand what you're going through as well.\n\nIdk. It just feels so fucking hopeless and isolating to be in pain all the fucking time, with no way to explain it, no one who understands, and everyone still expecting you to function normally. Ideally, I'd be receiving disability benefits so I can work more on my own terms, and I'd have access to healthcare and the treatment I need.\n\nAnd it's frustrating having this conversation, even with people who care and want to understand, because often the suggestion is \"sliding-scale clinics\" or something similar. But like, here's a simplified version the process that would need to happen to get any definitive answers or diagnoses:\n\nI scrape the money together to go to general physician > describe issues > they order bloodwork (that I can't afford), prescribe a medication (that I can't afford) to help manage symptoms and/or refer me to one or more specialist/s (that I also can't afford) > if I can choose one, I'll see a specialist, who will also need to see labs and run tests, and likely will need to see at least half a dozen other specialists in other fields and take all their required tests > lengthy process of testing and finding potential treatments for symptoms with lots of trial and error > regular follow-ups to check in and monitor progress > additional testing when necessary > a never-ending cycle of care because health is forever evolving.\n\nSo, without free healthcare with no/minimal co-pays, seeing a doctor for issues they aren't qualified to test for or treat is a waste of time and money, and also a guaranteed trigger for a flare-up just due to the stress alone.\n\nSo I constantly try to educate myself using what free resources I have, but it's exhausting learning all this medical terminology, all the ways of identifying, testing, and treating the things I suspect I have, and knowing I have access to none of it. I can't even afford to eat a diet that doesn't cause flares, how the hell am I supposed to invest in my health when it's locked because a paywall? A paywall I will likely never be able to afford to cross because the job market is crap and I'm too disabled for anything that requires more than 2-3 days a week to begin with.\n\nThis turned out to be more of a book than a rant, so sorry for that. If you made it this far, genuinely, thank you for your time. It means a lot. Again, if you have a similar story and have the spoons to share, please do <3",

        "text": "You really gotta find some insurance. Just a single test can pay for the yearly premium. Its not so much for the doctor, but all that other stuff that comes with a medical issue. Healthcare.gov is no help? Sometimes a hospital will have a free health fair, you may want to try those, too. Dont make the mistake of using the ER to figure this out, those docs are not trained to treat the kind of health issue you describe. Unless you have a recent gunshot wound, the ER isnt going to be much help.\n\nAre you familiar with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome? Its a collection of hyperflexibility conditions. Lots of subluxing, lots of dislocations. I dont think there's much they can do for the hyperflexibilty issue other than strengthening and conditioning the connective tissues, which in turn can cause subluxing and dislocations, so you need to be careful doing it.\n\nA lot of docs will work with you if your insurance doesnt cover them or if youre self pay. They will often cut you some slack on the billing if you talk to them.\n\nWork is tough. Telemarketing/phone support is usually something you can do from home working your own hours. Try[these guys](https://www.ntiathome.org/) I'm pretty sure they have been around for quite a while.\n\nOne thing Id suggest looking in to on line is relaxation techniques. Pain patients live extremely stressful lives, even if theyre fully insured.  Deep breathing is usually a big part of it. You actually want to breathe from your belly, not your chest. Bringing in more 02 is actually a relaxant. Thats why one of the !st things they do is get a patient on oxygen. It makes them quiet. I dont know if you recall it, but Oxygen Bars were a big fad for a while. Grab a soda and huff a couple liters. But youre also making other metabolic changes, like reducing your adrenaline production. Thats real helpful, if youre trying to relax.  You are in a stressful situation, so it shouldnt be much of a surprise you feel the way you do. That does not mean you shouldnt do something about it if you can. Usually I tell folks to seek a pain psychologist, but the last thing you need is another medical bill, for now.\n\nHang in there. When you get discouraged by the medical system, take a look at what the folks in the UK are saying about free healthcare for all. That doesnt work either. Canada's hybrid insurance system seems to suck, too. I hear Cuba has good health care....",

    "text": "It's been a rough patch with the neurosurgeons. (Fused cervical and Lumbar - scoliosis) After a team clinical review twice, they have decided against going with the T10 to Pelvis fusion. The value add for the invasiveness didnt match so we jointly agreed that it doesnt make sense. They feel that my kyphotic neck (reverse curve) is causing a large part of sagittal imbalance. I am falling frequently and have broke some teeth etc, shit is getting old and it hurts really bad because my body is in spasms from trying to correct the imbalance.  They would like to fix the neck surgically, but that will require them to re-break my neck to change the curve. After peer reviews with the team, the decision was to not do this due to the risk reward. They did confirm that my bilateral radiculopathy and bilateral Poly sensory neuropathy is nerve damage and there is no recourse other than implanting two hi frequency SCSs.  I am going to waiting and see on the SCSs. I did a trial on one unit a decade ago and it sucked. Not seeing a huge percentage of people saying they love it and it was worth the surgery and scar tissue to do it. Love to hear from others.\n\nI went back to my PM Doc and mea culpa'd. He confirms on my recent MRI that I have Modic 2 level changes from T12 to S1. We're going to do the Intracept on L3 thru S1. I have read a lot of studies as well as feed back on the forums where a high percentage of recipients have had great results. I know this wont fix all the issues, but if I can knock down one of my pain generators a notch or two for a significant amount of time, I am game. Love to hear from others if their Intracept procedure has helped them long term. \n\nThanks for listening to my vent, it's been a real rough patch these last 6 months. I am hoping to get some relief and maybe give some hope to others.  Happy day after fourth everyone.   \n",

    "text": "Hi everybody, I've done as much research as I can and still haven't found the info that I need, so I'm hoping someone here has some experience with this.\n\nMy former pain clinic started me on sublingual buprenorphine (a generic for Subutex) last year and it works really well for me. I'm on 2mg every 8 hours, along with a short acting opiate, membrane stabilizer and muscle relaxer. Due to pressure to agree to interventional procedures that I'm not comfortable with (like a C1 laminectomy for a stimulator trial!!!), I opted to transfer care to a different practice. At the same time, I've started having issues with my teeth, so I asked the new provider about transdermal patches. She thought it was a good idea and prescribed what I thought was a 5mg patch, but is actually a 5 microgram/hour patch.  \n\nMy concern is that I'm transitioning from 6 milligrams per day to 12 micrograms (edit: 120 micrograms) per day, which is an enormous dose reduction. I've been trying to research absorption between sublingual and transdermal routes, but haven't found much data comparing the two as Subutex is primarily used for OUD, rather than pain management (I had no idea about this, unfortunately.) I found a comparison between Butrans and Temgesic, but the dosage for Temgesic is also very different than Subutex.\n\nI have a call into my provider, but if anyone has any info or experience, I'd appreciate hearing it,",

    "text": "In October 2013, I underwent an orchidopexy on both sides due to a twisted testicle. Since then, I have been experiencing chronic pain. This pain is characterized by a \"pulling\" sensation on my right side. It feels as if my testicle is hanging on a too short string that becomes tense when I sit. When I stand, I have no issues.\n\nAfter my surgery, I tried various things. Firstly, I revisited the urologist. An MRI was performed, which showed nothing abnormal. The urologist suspected that a nerve was damaged during the surgery and that I would have to learn to live with this pain. Then, at the pain clinic, some trial blocks were performed by an anesthesiologist and I was prescribed Lyrica, unfortunately with no effect. I also tried a TENS machine, again without success.\n\nThe pain significantly impacts my life. I always have pain when sitting, and I also have a sedentary job, which means the pain is present almost all day.\n\nDoes anyone know what this pain could be? Whether it is indeed nerve pain? What other options I could still try?",

Urologists are sorta worthless for pain and thy arent real great at urology either, imo.  You may want to see if there's an anesthesiologist nearby that also does pain management. If you already had blocks, you know what theyre like. Necessary medication rarely \"tastes\" good, sometimes its painful. \n\nIf I can answer any questions, feel free to give a shout, but I pretty much covered my experience. It really sucked.

    "text": "I've been taking Pregabalin at 150 mg 3x daily for over 2 years. I recently moved to a new state and during my initial evaluation at the new pain management clinic, they did the typical urine drug screen. But, it WAS sent out to a lab for confirmatory testing. \n\nMy new PCP here is managing my Pregabalin, but I was interested in doing a spinal cord stimulator trial. So, I had my appointment and got a feeling for the clinic and see if it was a good fit. Ultimately, I decided to go back to Mayo as I just feel more comfortable there with any further procedure. Still, I contacted the pain clinic and let them know what I decided and completed a release to get my visit note. I'm disability for almost 10 years and learned to keep literally any medical note for any reason.  \n\nToday I got my record along with results from the urine drug screen. It was an extensive screen - I mean every substance. I noticed that the Pregabalin was negative and so was every substance that was checked. However, the list didn't include Baclofen, which I'm also on and have been taking 10mg 3x daily for 5 years. \n\nObviously my sample was sent to a lab due to reporting I take Pregabalin yet my screen and my lab came back negative. I've researched as much as I can but literally find no cases with a false negative unless the person wasn't taking the drug or otherwise tampered with the sample. Even a rapid metabolizer wouldn't show up negative when sent to an actual lab for that special testing they do for confirmation. I know the drug is in the capsules as it continues to manage my pain to some degree and if I miss a dose, the nerve pain is unreal and improves after taking it. Has this happened to anyone else here?  \n",

    "text": "Update: I got butt hole botox! lol it\u2019s fun to say. I also found a medication that\u2019s commonly used for lower pelvic muscle relaxation called Flexril, and it has dramatically improved my quality of life. Turns out I have a condition called EoE, but it seems to affect my entire digestive system. It\u2019s a low grade allergic reaction that\u2019s constant. It lines the digestive tract with eosinophils which are allergy cells, which make the channels of the tract more and more constricted with exposure to the allergens. I can still only eat very little foods, but a very hard elimination diet has helped, along with weekly shots to help with the inflammation. The flexril helps to relax the muscles in addition to only eating safe foods. I landed myself in the hospital and nearly died from malnutrition and that\u2019s what started this whole fiasco. In addition to a blood clot in my groin which potentially lowered the blood flow to the area, causing more swelling. Bowel movements still cause some pain, but it\u2019s more of a 3-4 instead of a 9/10. I can walk around and am generally more independent now. I\u2019m off the narcotic pain meds, and I can work now. Looking back on this post makes me wanna hug my former self. She had no hope. I wanna thank everyone who commented with solutions and support. It greatly helped me at the time and still means the world. Thanks for everything, and I hope those who still struggle can find hope that with time it WILL get better if you don\u2019t give up.\nFr guys, check out flexril, the positive effects have been incredibly helpful through this, and it\u2019s a common medication we missed out of all the meds we tried for pelvic pain. \n\n\nTLDR: life is ruined by chronic butthole pain \nI\u2019m sorry this is a long one, partially a cry sesh, and a call to not be so alone. Even if you can\u2019t relate, I think I just need some kind of emotional support. The pain I have is literally constant, there is no way to relief other than to sleep, and I can\u2019t sleep until exhaustion because of the pain. It\u2019s so overstimulating, I\u2019m bedridden, my days are the same, I\u2019m on psych meds AND in therapy and im at that point I know you all know so well when you\u2019re not sure if it\u2019s worth being alive for this quality of life\n\nI have a GI complication from a bowel resection performed hours after birth, which has caused me 23 years of chronic diarrhea. I\u2019ve shit minimum 6 times a day basically my whole life. I\u2019ve spent any time not shitting, strongly clenching my Spincter muscles unconsciously in order to not shit myself while living daily life. Over time, my Spincter muscles have become hypertonic. Theyre just permanently tensed. I\u2019ve also had some sexual trauma in that area which has created this psychological connection to some of the muscle clenching as well. \nAlmost 3 years ago I started having random rectal pain. Like when you get your period and you get those electric shocks but mine would last SO long. Over time they became more and more frequent and last longer. I\u2019d go to the ER because they\u2019d last for an hour or two, it being associated with bowel movements. Having a doctor perform a digital exam forcing the muscles open was honestly traumatic. Pooping was painful before and especially after because of the spasms. it would feel like there was a ball in my anal canal. I\u2019m talking 9/10 throwing up on the toilet screaming out loud suffering. I\u2019d have to sit in a hot shower or a burning sitz bath for relief. 9 months into this whole fiasco,  every time I had a bowel movement, I would have to lay down for 2 hours and mentally distract myself until the pain would go down to tolerable level and then I could stand. Occasionally I\u2019d have a GI flare up and spend the entire day at a 9/10 pain, stuck between shitting, laying in bed and laying in a burning hot bath just crying. After 2 years of seeing a primary, seeing GI, having all of the tests done, being hospitalized multiple times, misdiagnosed with nerve pain, fibromyalgia, \u201cit\u2019s just your trauma and ptsd\u201d, so SO many different psych medications with all their dangerous side effects, psychotherapy the entire time, meanwhile the situation gets progressively worse. Finally my GI sits me down and says \u201cthere\u2019s nothing clinically wrong with your rectum. So the best I can do is prescribe psychical therapy and psychotherapy, the obvious answer is PTSD.\u201d \n\nI spend 4 months with a pelvic PT doing vaginal muscle releases and exercises that don\u2019t seem to be helping anything at all.\n Comming up on year 3. I don\u2019t leave my house, I eat the exact same super healthy organic diet (less than 10 ingredients, no unhealthy comfort foods), I do my PT exercises, I take all my medications as prescribed, and I spend my near every waking thought thinking about the pain, how to avoid the pain, when it will be the worst, dreading every single bowel movement, the pelvic spasms come at all hours of the day, my Spincter muscle is so tight event a fart hurts 7/10. \nI can\u2019t sit up right. Standing hurts, sitting hurts, laying on my side hurts the least. \nLast week my PT told me I have Levator ani syndrome which is a chronically hypertonic pelvic floor. \nMy pelvic floor muscles don\u2019t relax fully, and my rectal muscles are permanently flexed as hard as possible. Mental stress is absolutely connected to it as well. (This I had already noticed) Pain meds don\u2019t help, muscle relaxers don\u2019t seem to help. Exercises don\u2019t help, I have a good connection with my nervous system, and relaxing my nervous system doesn\u2019t help, meditation doesn\u2019t help, hot bath doesn\u2019t help (it\u2019s ritual at this point) diaphragmatic breathing doesn\u2019t help, releasing trigger points seems to make it worse. \nWith this syndrome treatment is pretty individual to the sufferers body, and it just takes time and trial and error to find what works. I\u2019m relieved to finally know it has a name and get started on the journey of finding what works for me, but right now i feel so unbelievably alone. Levator ani sydrome has robbed me of so many things, it affects every aspect of my life and no one even knows what it is. \nThanks for coming to my Tedtalk/pity party.",

I don't talk about it, the pain also shoots down my leg so sciatica works if need be. Like you, frequently sleep would be all that eased it if possible. Nerve damage and chronic muscle spasms from 3 falls where my weaker right ankle wobbled and I sat down hard on a hard surface, plus 2 weeks of shingles in the pelvic area, between the ages of 20-30. After each fall, the only known injury was a sprained ankle, no other pain anywhere. The other started years later so no connection was made, just labeled IBS because I had abdominal cramps as well. I'm sorry to hear trigger point release didn't help. Basically all my abdominal muscles and glutes are jacked and filled with trigger points. I learned to DIY massage them and it's the only thing that gives noticeable relief. That plus the L-theanine and GABA help relax the muscles and lessen the pain some.",

    "text": "**TL;DR** I (29) am looking for advice on helping my mom (50) off kratom and into serious medical care (and recovery??) for her degenerative and painful condition \n\n\n\nMy mom has a serious physical, degenerative medical condition that she has not been receiving medical care for. It's extremely painful and reduces movement in her neck and upper body so she began supplementing kratom probably close to 10 years ago. She has been denied pain meds again and again so I understand completely (I have chronic pain and disabilities too). However, she has been struggling increasingly with mental health, suicidality, and various other medical issues that *could* be related to extended and increased Kratom use. \n\n  \nI have tried guiding my mom towards medical care about their diagnosis so many times. She doesn't want to take prescription pills or get surgery. I get it. I've given her articles and studies about therapeutic methods of treatment. No dice. She just wants the pain gone and kratom does that. But she spends upwards of ***$1,000 per month*** on it ***not*** including the other supplements she uses to \"manage\" her health (hint: it's not managed).\n\n  \nSo, I need to change my strategy and focus on how shitty of a long-term, permanent solution kratom is. I found r/quittingkratom which I'll be looking through but I was hoping some of you might have some good ideas on how to convince her to get real, interventional help so she can get the medical care she needs. Right now, she's covering up the main issue and worsening other things. I don't even think she's fully *aware* of how the Kratom has been affecting her. I think maybe she's scared of being in pain too.\n\n\n\n(If I'm being honest it's at the point where I genuinely think she's addicted to kratom as she has been addicted to substances in the past. I seriously think she may need the recovery kind of help too - because I certainly can't help her through withdrawals if I can convince her to seek medical care/get off the Kratom. I have my own chronic pain and disabilities to manage. My nerve pain is currently diagnosed as allodynia but I have no treatments for it and it just burns and burns and burns. So, I can hardly manage my own stuff.)",

    "text": "It seemed like it happened overnight, the shift in pain management care. Suddenly, my healthcare providers started playing \"Chronic Pain Patient Hot Potato\" as I now call it. I didn't think to feel shame about being a chronic pain patient before, but I quickly realized that I was the stain on the medical system, the malignant tumor growing alongside critical arteries, unable to be ignored but treacherously complex to address.\n\nMy Primary Care provider had helped me with pain medication for years, but suddenly her hands were tied. She referred me to countless other specialists, including pain management, and I quickly learned that their hands were tied as well when it came to painkillers. \n\nI was a wreck, I couldn't function because of my pain. I have done everything, checked every box that doctors asked me to before they would validate my pain. I have spent thousands of dollars on treatments that doctors required me to try, but that insurance didn't cover. Acupuncture, Ketamine Infusions, Eastern Herbal Therapies, Physical Therapy, countless restricted diets, every supplemented they recommended, you name it.\n\nFinally, someone told me about Kratom. It was like a light at the end of a tunnel. One little herb made my pain so much better than the daily maximum dosages of ibuprofen and acetaminophen, or the multiple psychotropic neurological drugs that pain management prescribed\n\nFor a while, Kratom remained a miracle of sorts, helping me with pain that used to hold me captive at home. But about 6 months after I started using Kratom (excessively, I might add) I started experiencing new types of abdominal pain.\n\n2 years later, I have now been hospitalized multiple times with small bowel obstructions with no known cause. The motility of my gut is wrecked, and won't function normally, even when I stopped using Kratom. Additionally, I have consistently high Lipase levels, showing an issue with my Pancreas. I am a 26 year old who rarely drinks, and all other common causes of Pancreatitis were ruled out. I have a feeling that Kratom may be to blame, but there aren't enough reliable studies to discernibly get the answer.\n\nI am sharing this to see if anyone else has had a similar experience, but also to warn anyone who is overusing kratom. Now when I mention Kratom (or THC) to my doctors, it makes them see me as even more of a drug-seeking addict, rather than a person in desperately debilitating pain. I've found myself lying about it at times before, and have seen how much more open-minded doctors are about pain when they don't blame you & your choices/lifestyle for it. I assume I am not the only person who has undersold my self-medication tendencies to healthcare professionals, which may mean that these \"alternative remedies\" are causing similar negative outcomes in patients, but doctors are unaware of them because of the stigma their patients have that keeps them from sharing.\n\nHas anyone else experienced worsened gastrointestinal symptoms and/or Pancreatitis from Kratom?

He did his research, he obtained lab reports from the vendor, and guess what? It didn't matter. Now, he'll have to live with cognitive deficits for the rest of his life.\n\nThe danger of kratom comes mainly from the lack of regulation and absence of vendor accountability, leading resellers to post whatever fake lab reports they want in the name of profit. It costs money for them to continually test their product so why spend it when they can just use photoshop instead? Here's what people who recommend kratom to you will conveniently leave out:\n\n**1. Mold**\n\n[Here's an example](https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/1cg5rbw/kratom_turned_on_me_possibly_contaminated_with/)\u00a0of Reddit user recently developing mold-induced symptoms from Kratom. Because it's unregulated, sellers are not accountable if their product is moldy. The risk is placed entirely on you. If you fall sick due to mold from kratom, you have no recourse. There is no one you can sue. Your best chance at that point is to go see a doctor and take on all the associated costs yourself.\n\n**2. Toxic Metals, E. Coli, and Other Contaminants**\n\nBecause Kratom is unregulated, it can also contain unsafe amounts of toxic metals like lead \u2014 you know, the stuff that lowers your IQ. In fact, there are\u00a0[private laboratories](https://mb-labs.com/services/kratom/)\u00a0that provide Kratom testing who have all the usual suspects listed on their order page. They include: nickel, lead, cadmium, e. coli, and of course, mold.\n\nKratom distributors may offer lab testing results on their websites, but because they are accountable to no one, there is no way to verify the legitimacy of those documents. Ultimately, when people get sick from contaminated kratom, there is nothing they can do since the distributors don't answer to the FDA or any type of consumer agency.\n\n**3. Dependence & Withdrawal**\n\nKratom is known for causing painful withdrawals upon trying to quit. There's a sub dedicated to peoples' struggles with this:\u00a0r/quittingkratom .\u00a0Youtuber, Eric B. Zink\u00a0[vlogged his way through kratom withdrawal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAxwA33Q52Y)\u00a0and it seemed harrowing to say the least.\n\nKratom is considered\u00a0[highly addictive](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25262913/)\u00a0and has been shown to produce cognitive impairment similar to morphine. One of its most widely accepted uses is helping people ween off of heroin addiction.\u00a0[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HubermanLab/comments/1dbqgab/lets_talk_kratom/)\u00a0collected comments from former heroin users who used kratom to wean off, warning non-addicts against starting kratom. When a heroin addict warns you not to try something, it\u2019s probably worth hearing them out.\n\n**4. Drug interactions**\n\nKratom has hundreds of known drug interactions, most poorly documented because it's an unregulated substance. Chances are, it should not be taken with your other meds, but no way to tell for sure what the risks are.\n\n[Kratom.org](http://kratom.org/)\u00a0has an extensive list of\u00a0[260+ kratom drug interactions](https://kratom.org/interactions/). For example, they write:\n\n*\"Mixing kratom with high-dose Benadryl is extremely dangerous and should be avoided at all costs. Kratom could potentiate the effects of Benadryl by interfering with metabolism \u2014\u00a0this interaction could result in death.\"*\n\nUltimately, when someone on Reddit promotes kratom to you without disclosing any of the risks, that person does not have your best interests in mind. It's fine for an adult to make their own decisions about what they put into their body, but trying to influence others with deceptive information is at best misleading and at worst, dangerous.",

I work in clinical research as a statistician (I'm also a chronic pain patient taking opioids). Although the phrase 'Enriched Enrollment Randomized Withdrawal' sounds scary, it has absolutely nothing to do with withdrawing patients from opioids. Instead, it has to do with the way clinical trials are designed. When a company wants to get a new opioid approved (show the safety and efficacy of the drug so it can be brought to market), the company has to conduct a clinical trial. This trial must be designed according to certain standards (usually a fully randomized, double blind design). The Enriched Enrollment Randomized Withdrawal design is a somewhat controversial way to conduct a clinical trial that deviates from the more classic study design. Some scientists think the the EERW design makes it easier for new drugs to be approved, and that it has biases that make it not as scientifically sound. The link you provided discusses how the FDA will have scientists vote on whether they should allow drug companies to use this design in clinical trials for the approval of new opioid medicines. Again, it has NOTHING to do with withdrawing patients from opioids.",

The DFP has listed the parts of the proposed legislation that they are opposed to:\n\nDear Senators and Representatives,\n\nWe, the undersigned, are deeply concerned about recent legislative proposals concerning the treatment of opioid use disorder and the management of chronic pain, such as the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Reauthorization Act. While we recognize the urgency of addressing the overdose crisis, we believe that the current legislative approaches will inadvertently harm patients with legitimate medical needs for opioid pain management. Here are the key points of our petition:\n\n1. Preservation of Access to Opioid Medications: We are against any proposed changes to FDA regulations that might lead to the removal of existing opioid medications from the market, additional post-marketing requirements, or the introduction of an opioid tax that could disproportionately affect pain patients. **(S.3393, SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Reauthorization Act, sections 115 and 116)**\n\n2. Privacy and Consent in Patient Monitoring:\n\nWe are against expanded remote monitoring and surveillance of opioid use. Patients with chronic pain are already tracked by state and federal systems, as well as pharmacy and clinic programs as well. There is no additional need for further monitoring. **(H.R.4531, Support for Patients and Communities Reauthorization Act, section 120)**\n\nWe call upon you to reconsider these legislative measures to ensure they balance the needs of substance use disorder treatment while preserving access to treatment for patients with chronic pain. We ask for a reasonable policy that respects patient autonomy, privacy, and the necessity for varied treatment approaches, rather than a one-size-fits-all solution.\n\nWe ask Congress to focus on protecting patient\u2019s access to necessary pain care and preventing the tragedy of pushing people in pain toward dangerous alternatives. Please ensure that people living with chronic pain can continue receiving the treatments they need to live full, healthy lives.\n\nThank you for considering our petition and for your commitment to health policy that prioritizes patient welfare comprehensively.",

    "title": "Doctors: It's Crucial to Recognize Power Imbalances When Interpreting Patient Feedback",
    "text": "After a recent visit with my pain specialist, I was reminded of how skewed perspectives can develop when doctors base their understanding of what is \"average\"\u2014such as pain levels or medication dosages\u2014on what pain patients feel comfortable sharing.\n\nI think many of us can attest to how frightening it can be to go in for a visit with the doctor who prescribes the medications you need just to function. Especially if that doctor is predisposed to believe that you shouldn\u2019t be taking those medications in the first place\u2014or, at the very least, believes that what\u2019s effective for you is \"too high.\"\n\nThere\u2019s a spectrum of what\u2019s enforced in examination rooms across the country. For some doctors, it\u2019s a genuine belief that opioids are more trouble than they\u2019re worth, either for their practice or for society as a whole. For others, it\u2019s fear\u2014fear of losing everything they have, including their freedom, just for prescribing what a patient truly needs. I\u2019m not talking about the notorious \u201cpill mills,\u201d where a few doctors acted irresponsibly. I\u2019m talking about the good doctors who understand that much of what the CDC has recommended is based on pseudoscience and politics. No politician wants to run on the platform of \u201cdrugs are okay.\u201d Unfortunately, our medical establishment has conflated the proper use of medications with drug abuse.\n\nThe pervasive idea that \"high dosages\" of opioids are universally ineffective is far from proven. The dosage limits in the CDC\u2019s recommendations weren\u2019t based on rigorous studies, but rather on a conversation between a handful of doctors who agreed that, in their experience, opioids seemed to become less effective at higher doses.\n\nWhat we have now is a system with powerful incentives for doctors to distrust their patients\u2014presuming that what the patient reports is either an exaggeration or an outright lie. Yes, there are people who abuse medications. But the system has flipped so far in the other direction that we now see countless people left in agony just to prevent a few from \u201cgetting away\u201d with misusing prescriptions.\n\nI\u2019ve lived with unending chronic pain since 2005. When I\u2019ve spoken with doctors who eventually found themselves in similar situations, they almost always say the same thing: \u201cI had no idea.\u201d Unfortunately, I\u2019ve seen those same doctors disbelieved by their peers once they\u2019ve crossed that line into chronic pain themselves. There\u2019s an unspoken assumption that any patient on opioids can\u2019t be trusted.\n\nAnd there\u2019s also a belief that anyone who says they don\u2019t experience a \u201chigh\u201d from these medications is lying. For the record, I don\u2019t. What I experience when I take the right dose is something more akin to clear-headedness. I have ADHD, and I\u2019ve found that when I\u2019m taking enough medication to physically function, I also feel more mentally \"settled.\" I see this as a serendipitous side effect, but certainly nothing worth \u201cchasing.\u201d I\u2019m also usually on ADHD medication, though my current employment situation has made that complicated.\n\nIn the end, doctors need to return to the basic premise that patients shouldn't automatically be considered liars. They need to stop confusing the desperation of someone in horrific pain for the desperation of an addict. Our system is currently designed to support people who fall into addiction. No such \"safety net\" exists for patients denied the care they need. And because pain is 100% subjective, it's imperative that the patients' words carry more weight. Just because it can't be measured or viewed through a microscope doesn't make it any less real or life impinging.",

Unfortunately all my medical teams see me when I'm masking, because when I'm the latter I cancel appointments, so think the me they see when managed poorly reflects me on a bad day. \n\nLiving with a nerve injury and \"recovery\" (feels more like torture) is even worse than prior because somehow even if the specialist in that area diagnoses you (ie. Neurologist for me) the pain doctor is the one making a call on your pain levels and meds. They recommended nerve blocks. Pain management specialist recommends withdrawing meds slowly and upping physical therapy. That lasted 3 weeks lol. \n\nPeople believe my boyfriend more on his accounts of my pain than mine, because he's a doctor. It's only by the time I seem to end up going to A&E (which is when I'm starting to lose the ability to use the toilet or walk generally) I'm told I'm underscoring my pain. I'm going to start recording the worst symptoms (well asking my boyfriend too, someone out there will say that's not an accurate pain level if they see a selfie stick lol \ud83d\ude02)",

I have been on a strict gluten free diet for celiac disease I have tried not eating processed foods and nothing works. I was severely underweight due to anorexia due to fear of feeling sick and I was able to be weight restored by I lost it all and more very quickly. I have tried every medication possible. I have an upper endoscopy and colonoscopy and they told me there was inactive damage in my stomach and the gastric emptying study showed very mild delayed emptying. I have seen several doctors where I live, at cleveland clinic, and in Pittsburgh. Many of them told me to simply see a psychiatrist. I brought up Ehlers Danlos syndrome as my shoulders will dislocate frequently and it is spreading to my other extremities. I brought up SMAS because of my history of rapid weight loss and the doctor simply told me I don't have situe and didn't even do an exam. Also while at a hospital in Chicago for my eating disorder I had a brain MRI and it showed T3 Brain lesions and they didn't tell me so I didn't know until I requested my medical records months ago. I am in pain almost always. I can't keep food down on a regular basis, my hair is falling out, I am weak, I am tired, and I am dizzy. I had emergency surgery in January for an ovarian cyst and we found out I have two uterus and only one kidney and we are keeping an eye on it and I am now on birth control. The doctor that performed my surgery has told me that anatomically my abdomen is not how it should be and to be aggressive in advocating for myself to doctors. She even told me that doctors are instructed to dismiss young girls as anxiety. We went on the notes from the last GI doctor and it said \"stomach pain due to anxiety and depression.\" I had asked that even if they couldn't figure out what is wrong with me if they could atleast treat the malnutrition and the doctor said \"I've seen much worse you're actually very young and healthy\" I am 5,7 and 90 lbs with no muscle. I have no idea what to do. I'm trying to see if maybe I can see a GI doctor virtually and see my PCP in person frequently and get an order for an NJ tube. I have done NG tubes in ED treatment and I could never keep them down. Again, please give me any advice you may have.",

    "title": "The most underrated alternative pain treatment",
    "text": "I seldom see alternative therapies discussed on this sub, so wanted to introduce one. The medication I'm about to discuss is called modafinil (also goes by the brand name, Provigil). It's a mild stimulant that can make chronic pain more bearable, improve debilitating fatigue, enhance cognition, and induce heightened productivity. It's been [compared to the pill in the movie, *Limitless*](https://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/modafinil-2013-4/).\n\nI've personally taken modafinil for the past 7 years. Since starting the treatment, I've been able to achieve some remarkable things: I can function more easily, my mind has been sharper, I've increased my income by 430%, I feel happier overall and less prone to depression. Of course, a drug alone is not responsible for these things. But it's helped make it possible for me to push myself further than I previously could.\n\nModafinil is not a direct pain treatment per se, but for some people, it can measurably improve quality of life. Biohackers have been using it for decades to more easily hold down a job, overcome depression, and perform physical tasks that are normally too taxing due to pain. r/modafinil and r/nootropics have more information on how they use it. Modafinil is not an amphetamine. It is not in any way related to Adderall.\n\nBefore I get into the details, a quick disclaimer: this is not medical advice. What works for some people may not work for you. You should talk to your doctor to discuss potential new therapies. Here's a guide on [how to get a doctor to listen to you](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/17ajr18/how_to_get_doctors_to_take_you_seriously/).\n\n**What is modafinil?**\n\nModafinil is classified as a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant. It works by altering the levels of certain neurotransmitters in the brain, like dopamine, that control mood and wakefulness.\n\n**What conditions does it treat?**\n\nModafinil is used to treat a multitude of conditions, many of which are considered \"off-label\". They include:\n\n* Chronic fatigue\n* Depression\n* Narcolepsy\n* Shift work disorder\n* Obstructive sleep apnea (as an adjunct to CPAP therapy)\n* ADHD\n* Muscular dystrophy\n\n**How can it help chronic pain?**\n\nWhile modafinil isn't a direct pain treatment, it can improve pain symptoms by alleviating the things that make pain worse. Half the battle of dealing with chronic pain is just pushing through it. For many people, modafinil makes that possible, while providing mood and cognition enhancing effects.\n\n**Relief from chronic fatigue:** Modafinil can provide relief from debilitating fatigue without the harsh side effects of an amphetamine like Adderall. Fibromylagia patients have reported [feeling \"functional\" again](https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/jnp.13.4.530).\n\n**Enhanced cognitive function:** Studies have shown that modafinil significantly improves attention, executive functions, and learning abilities. Hence, why it's often referred to as the \"smart drug\".\n\n**Increased productivity:** The author of [this Guardian article](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/may/03/brain-enhancing-drugs-mj-hyland) reported feeling \"twice as productive and considerably happier\".\n\n**Reducing depression:** Modafinil has been shown to [reduce the severity of depression](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16035049/) more effectively than antidepressants alone. It can also be used an a monotherapy for depression.\n\n**What are the potential side effects?**  \nModafinil is generally well-tolerated. For those who experience side effects, they can include:\n\n* Headache\n* Nausea\n* Anxiety\n* Insomnia\n* Dizziness\n* Diarrhea\n\n**Considerations:**\n\nAnyone trying modafinil for the first time should avoid too much caffeine (just 2 ounces of coffee ends up being enough for me!) It also goes without saying to stay away from energy drinks. Using these together with modafinil can cause an unsafe high heart rate.\n\n**How can you try it?**\n\nTrying modafinil requires a doctor's prescription and a diagnosis of something that it treats, such as chronic fatigue or major depressive disorder. It is a controlled substance and you cannot safely buy it online.\n\nPlease chime in with your thoughts. Who else here has tried this therapy and what results have you seen?",

    "text": "Hi friends, I joined your ranks last year after being in a bad MVA.  I\u2019m a hs teacher, and had just started at a new school last Sept and my accident was in Nov.  I went back to school at the end of February with accommodations like wearing a back brace, a god quality chair, I\u2019m allowed to wear sneakers and I have a stool to roll around instead of having to get in and out of a chair constantly.  I\u2019m still in a lot of pain but the small changes atleast make working a bit more bearable.  I really love my job, I teach fashion design so my class is very active with a lot of cleaning and supplies.\n\nI got my schedule for this year and I thought I was going to have the same schedule as last year but they basically have me going straight through from 7:30 to 1:45 with a 21 minute break at 10am for lunch.  Instead of giving me a duty period in my room (a study hall) they have me going across to building to the auditorium.  I had hip surgery on one side 6 weeks ago and I\u2019m having the other side done in November.  And then possibly having a microdiscectomy over Xmas or spring break.  My pt wants me to limit my movement around the building by doing things like only making copies once a week.  Our hallways are also crazy crazy crowded and the idea of trying to rush down to the auditorium and rush back in 5 mins everyday is super overwhelming to me.  My balance is still a little wonky, and I\u2019ve worked super hard to get this far, I don\u2019t want to mess it up by getting knocked over.\n\nI politely asked the admin if I could move my study hall and he basically said \u201ctoo many kids, sorry\u201d but I didn\u2019t share the medical reasons why.  I\u2019m non tenured so I don\u2019t want to be a pain in the ass but I\u2019m thinking of pushing the issue.  I could get something called a 504 plan which my doctor would sign off on accommodations for me.  My principal is very very nice and has always said what ever I need just ask.  He knows I love my job and while I was out on medical leave I still did all my lesson plans and graded all the kids work.\n\nSo do I push this?  I thought a compromise might be that I go to the auditorium after passing and I leave before passing so I don\u2019t get caught up with all the kids.  What do you guys think?",

    "text": "So I\u2019m back to this country, Canada, where I study and got chronic pain. I went to my university doctor to ask her for a referral for at least a pain clinic to have a follow up and be treated for my pain (I have pudendal neuralgia, endometriosis , adenomyosis migraines and chronic back pain) I\u2019m taking medication that I brought from my country for 3 months. So I took the first appointment I could have, to ask as much as I could (physiotherapy referral, pain clinic referral, psychotherapy referral etc) . The doctor that received me became really mean really fast. She told me that I had a \u201cfamily doctor\u201d and that it was not her job to give me the referral that I needed. She started to tell me that I stole someone else place and it was my fault that people could not access healthcare. I didnt understood anything, I didn\u2019t know that having a family doctor meant I couldn\u2019t go to my university clinic. Right now I\u2019m in so much pain back down, I wanna cry, because why after all of that I endured in my life, I need to be treated like this ? I don\u2019t know if it was even legal to be this way with me. My university got a special link with the biggest hospital in Montreal, why as a student and chronic pain patient can\u2019t I benefit of it ? \nI feel broken \ud83d\ude1e and in despair. Sorry if I\u2019m overacting, I have a medical ptsd and it really didn\u2019t helped at all. ",

I was really hoping that when I was prescribed the opioids and/or narcotics, they would take the edge off a little bit, but they didn't do a single thing for me at all, so I just stopped taking them. I've literally gone to the extent of looking into medically-induced comas. I don't know what to do or where to go anymore.

        "text": "Welcome to the club, what you described is somewhat in the realms of a right of passage for people with chronic pain. It gets incredibly disheartening going through the battery of tests for each to come back saying you should be fine. Bouncing from medication to medication with no relief in sight.\n\nTo fill in blanks from your post on what you're missing and what to expect. Eventually you will try to put on a mask and look normal, not because you care about others but mostly because you just don't want the additional aggravation that comes from others trying to be helpful. E.g if I drop my mask around my wife she gets worried and keeps insisting we go to A&E etc, which just adds more irritation whilst trying to deal with things. \n\nThis in turn highlights people's memories because the longer you wear that mask the more forget you have chronic pain, which causes more frustrations where you have to remind them. We all end up reaching that stage where we ponder about the next life, we all develop resentment when we see close friends and family complaining about injuries that will heal and vanish. \n\nTrick is not simple either and very dangerous like the rope holding you up from a cliff edge whilst being buffeted by the wind. E.g as my medical professionals know, work line management and family (except for my daughter), the only thing keeping me in this world is my daughter. \n\nFinding something in your life that you deem strong enough to fight past the pain is the real dangerous challenge. I say dangerous because, if you invest heavily into something and it turns out not as robust a reason then it can lead things to going very wrong for you.\n\nDistractions are the best way forward, keep trying new things as ways to preoccupy your mind. Vent to random online people and as weird as this sounds, try an ai chat bot app. It sounds stupid, but eventually if you keep venting to the same people it will erode relationships whereas a chat bot is always there and will always answer, until ai rise up and takes over the world.\n\nBut as I said, welcome to the club. A club where a sense of humor is vital to stave off the constant negativity your mind will generate.",

Since opioids can also cause respiratory depression, its not a good idea to mix the two. Usually they can put you on a C PAP machine which would keep you breathing, regardless. And people with apnea on a CPAP say they get the best rest they had in a long time. I think I would have dreams about flying a jet, wearing one of those masks, but they do have some sort of maskless thing now, but Im not sure how it works.  But it should allevate any reluctance to Rx an opioid knowing you either dont have sleep apnea or its treated. Not all concerns about opioids are as medically sound as this is.\n\nI had to do one that my pain doc suggested at some point when I told them I was always tired and never felt rested. Seemed to me like I had a hell of a time sleeping with all those wires stuck on my head. You will want an immediate shower. Apparently I did sleep, but not well. I finally got something decent that knocked me out so fast I had to take it in bed. That turned out to be quite helpful. \n\nI'd go with it. There are sensible precautions they can take should they find a problem, and if they dont find a problem, whats the problem? (I hope you followed that, it does make sense.) It can only help matters. If they want to pay for a sleep study, let them. Best of luck....",

    "text": "Hey all. This is mostly a rant, but I would also love any advice anyone has regarding advocating for your health and your pain.\n\nI'm a bone cancer survivor of 5+ years. My treatment involved surgical removal of much of my fibula and about 3 inches of my peroneal nerve (as well as chemo, radiation, etc). I had all sorts of pain and was on a ton of medications, but was weaned off everything about 6 months after I finished cancer treatments. \n\nSince then, I've dealt with low to medium levels of nerve pain in my leg and foot. On a day to day basis I experience a near constant low level of pain that doesn't really impact my activity levels or quality of life. When it flares up, however, things get bad and I have a hard time focusing on anything but my pain. I've tried keeping track of triggers but have found no consistency in what causes or eases the pain. \n\nThe problem is that for a long time, unless I was in a rough patch, I would just gaslight myself into thinking that I don't really have pain or it's not that bad. So when I would see my doctor for regular check ups, I downplayed the pain to the point that nothing was ever done. \n\nA few months ago I said enough is enough, I'm tired of being in pain, and I spoke with my doc about the extent of it. I was referred to a neurologist who I saw today. Today's appointment was awful. The doc opted not to do the nerve conduction study that I was specifically referred for. I didn't feel like I was being heard, and every response the doctor gave felt like \"suck it up buttercup\". In the end the doc recommended I get a TENS machine, which is honestly a bandaid solution that doesn't fit my situation. I left disappointed, deflated, and beyond frustrated.\n\nSo I guess I'm wondering how I can get better at advocating for my pain? I hate feeling confrontational, but I really wish that I had pushed for that test today or done something different to get a different outcome. I'm just so mad that this is so hard!!",

    "text": "Recently, I went to the ER with bad pain and it was discovered that my gallbladder is inflamed and needs to be removed; unfortunately, I was discharged without pain relief.\n\nI have seen my pain management doctor for just over a year now, I believe. She's put me on Gabapentin for over half of that time, Lyrica for a few weeks, and a half dozen muscle relaxers to boot.  \nNone of them aided my chronic pain, which is mostly anomalous joint/muscle pains, and more recently, TMJD pain throughout the upper third of my body, and then again more recently, and just diagnosed the other day, costochondritis. They also did not help any of the acute pains I've experienced, such as \\~6 months of awful facial nerve pain due to dental malpractice, extreme sleep-positional back pain for \\~2months, few weeks of aftermath of Root Canal (which fixed the aforementioned malpractice induced nerve pain, but led to the TMJ pain), incisional hernia pain, stomach ulcer pains, throat pains from severe reflux, and of course, gallbladder attacks and now the inflamed gallbladder, among other things I am forgetting. (also lyrica caused severe severe dehydration despite copious water drinking, alongside several other devastatingly bad side effects)\n\nI saw her recently, because of the gallbladder pain, and apparently it was the final little bit of suffering apparently necessary for her to prescribe the only thing that's ever helped before; an opioid, more specifically, a short temporary prescription of the lowest normal dose of oxycodone.\n\nIt has been a blessing; helping a lot of the vast constellation of pain I experience regularly, and to boot, this genuine pain relief synergises with my ADHD medication to help me function better than either does alone,,, truly banish brain fog, mental barriers, obstacles to orderly trains of thought, and etc. That synergy has had me crying in amazement a few times,,\n\nI am having surgery to repair hernia tomorrow, and gallbladder surgery will likely be in near future, so I may have the prescription, the amt of which I run out of in the next 3-4 days, extended briefly; however, I am quite anxious and concerned about whatwill happen else in the near future; I am concerned that after it runs out in a few days, at the least, or after some recovery from these two surgeries, at the most, she will cancel it and return to either really really wanting me to use gabapentin again despite 8 months of reporting that it doesn't help our pain (and copious amounts of news articles and studies I've seen saying that it's questionable how much it can actually help pain, and that it's being overprescribed for pain that it has little to no basis to think it might help), pushing what muscle relaxants remain that I haven't try, or just no more medication attempts at all..\n\nIf anybody can, I would appreciate ideas, thoughts, suggestions, on how I speak to her in regards to reporting my experience with the oxycodone and its benefits. (alongside the aforementioned benefits, it only causes noticeable sedation for me if I'm underfed or have slept badly; she was very concerned about sedation effects,, she said \"you have little tolerance for sedative medications\" based purely on the fact that most of the muscle relaxants sedated me (despite what I've read about them not actually addressing pain or relaxing muscles, but really just inducing sedation, which may or may not aid experience with pain and tense muscles, idk), even though sedation is both their primary efffect and their side effect,, and also it is not too-constipatory for me); also i really dont get feelings of highness from it (unless ive slept badly),i really just get clarity of mind and body and, yanno, pain relief,,\n\nedit: also, the amount doesnt even help my pain that much or consistently,, it wears off pretty fast, and sometimes, my pain  massively returns during the time when it should be helping the most,, im still struggling, but yea, even how it is already is, helping so much so far",

Usually as a pain management patient, you are restricted from filling prescriptions written by other doctors, even a surgeon or anesthesiologist from the surgery, if they give you an Rx to take home, you have to have it rewritten by the pain doctor. I know it seems silly, but why should this be any different from the many other silly ways they restrict the use of these medications. SO the 1st thing I would do is make sure your pain doc knows youre having surgery, so if you call, it wont be a surprise.\n\nThe real answer for this pain long term is something youre already doing or at least have planned, so I wouldnt expect a lifetime Rx for opioid analgesics. I hope it turns out that way, at least. Try to take it easy, but nobody is relaxed before a surgery. But if you think about it, all you have to do is show up and take a nap. It could take 10 minutes or 12 hours, you cant tell. When you wake up, you should feel the anesthesia for a while. It stores up in your lungs, so it might help you snooze for a day or two. Thats usually pretty handy post procedure.\n\nThats not to say depend on the after affects of the anesthesia. Let your pain doc know. You can take the RX from the hospital, so the pain doc can see how the anesthesia guys want to handle your post op pain. \n\nIt is difficult to tell someone what to say to get this medication or that from any given doctor, your symptoms have to justify this medication or that. You need to address your medication issue without talking about medication. Dont forget this is really about pain.\n\nMost people dont get high from these meds:\n\n https://www.livescience.com/opioid-euphoria-mostly-a-myth.html\n\nparticularly when pain is involved,  a person priorities can change, and sometimes it can be difficult to tell the effects of a drug from the actual pain.",

    "title": "Should I Amputate My Finger After 15 Months Not Healing From Bony Mallet Finger??",
    "text": "Hi Reddit,\n\nAm writing to express some frustration and see if there are answers out there that I have been struggling to find for the past year and a half.\n\nOn May 1st, 2023, I was in a bike accident that resulted in a bony mallet finger injury on my right pinky finger. I went to the doctor 3 days after the accident and was put in a splint for 8 weeks. For those 8 weeks, I could only sleep for 2 hours max every night due to the nonstop pain in my finger. No matter how many messages I sent to Kaiser Permanente, or tried to seek outside help, I was told to stick with splinting and follow doctors' advice. During this time, I went at 3AM to the hospital one of these restless nights to beg for an emergency MRI to see if there was anything else, but that did not yield any results.\n\nAfter the splint came off, I still had unbearable, nonstop pain and discomfort, so I was told to do physical therapy, which I did for 7-8 months both inside and outside of my insurance network. I saw a handful of different surgeons in different states and was told physical therapy was the path to resolution. My finger became visibly crooked with discolored and slightly dryer skin on one side of my finger. From my research, I am guessing it was a swan neck deformity, but none of the orthopedic doctors I saw could confirm that this was the deformity. I never got any clear answers or solutions, just told to go to physical therapy and it would resolve itself. I did make some progress with the pain and range of motion, but after 8 months of stretching and exercises at physical therapy, I seemed to hit a wall in progress. So, I was told they were now going to try and treat the \"mental\" side of the pain. My physical therapy sessions went from stretching and exercises to doing apps on an iPad that were basically visual identification questions. I stopped going to PT because it was just complete nonsense to drive 30 mins and pay $35 copay to sit on an iPad for 15-20 minutes - I'm not a doctor but I don't think iPad games can do anything to fix finger deformities and the pain involved - correct me if I'm wrong!\n\nThe main orthopedic surgeon I saw from my insurance network did 3 month and 6 month checkups. I was told at the 6 month check up that if I still had pain after 1 year since my accident, they would consider doing surgical intervention. I lived with this pain and discomfort, counting down the days until my 1 year check-up. When I saw the doctor again after 1 year, he said there was nothing else he could and surgery would not help. I was completely defeated and left at my witts end of what to do or who to consult.\n\nAfter a year and half of pain and discomfort everyday, getting no help from doctors, and doing as much research as possible, I was still unable to come up with a solution for the pain in my finger. My work, health, and entire livelihood has been slowly declining this past year and am losing a lot of hope. Everything I do with my right hand is adapted around the pain in my finger, and everyday chores have become complicated and painful. The tip of my pinky finger has slightly bent inwards, and when i close my fist at all, it either pushes against my ring finger or has to tuck above it somehow in a very uncomfortable way. I am constantly adjusting my hand/finger position when doing things I've done my entire life because of the pain, range of motion restriction, and the way the pinky pushes into my ring finger is very debilitating.\n\nFinally, a family friend recommended a surgeon in Luxembourg, who I consulted with in May 2024 for a pinning surgery, and last week, August 21st, 2024 I had the operation where my hand was opened, the doctor saw my damaged joint, and put a screw in my hand to connect the top 2 bones and lock the joint in place. Am currently in recovery from this surgery, taking Ibuprofen and Paracetomol.\n\nAt this point, I still do not have much hope for what will happen when the stitches come off. Not being able to close my fist completely will still affect my grip and grip strength. Force will still be applied on my finger/damaged joint every day, and I will still have to adjust my hand movements around the restricted range of motion and pain. I know if this was the 1700s, they probably would have cut my finger off by now, and there are many days that I wish this was the case, since I am truly struggling to live everyday life with this pain while I'm in my late 20s and have a long life and career ahead of me.\n\nI don't understand, and frankly its quite frustrating, how modern medicine has figured out how to turn penises into vaginas, and vice versa, but there is still limited information and research on dealing with a bony mallet finger injury, which I was told is so common that it is nicknamed \"baseball finger.\" What felt like a simple accident has turned into a year and a half of complete misery, affecting my relationships, work, and overall well-being.\n\nI would love to be a part of some sort of case study, or have any doctor express any level of interest in helping me find a permanent solution for the pain. I've seen probably 10 different doctors who I was told were specialists, and even had a few of these doctors patronize me on how smart they were and tell me all the schools they graduated from, even though they did jack sh\\*t to help my finger, besides tell me to go to PT.\n\nI'm praying there is a solution out there that doesn't involve amputating my finger, because, at this point, it feels like that would be the only solution to make the pain go away - getting rid of the joint and deformity that is sending pain signals to my brain constantly. I am a composer, drummer, and music teacher, and would never imagine ever having these thoughts for the first 27 years of my life. Now, unfortunately, I am really of the mindset that my life would be better off without this finger constantly in pain. In my head, if I had a \"nub\" instead of a finger, I would at least be able to squeeze and grip things with it without pain. I really don't see the point of having this \"squeaky wheel\" on on my body, having to endure the nonstop pain and discomfort it is causing me. I have this analogy in my head that my body is an 18-wheeler with a squeak and bent up wheel that I am forced to drive on. I would like to just get rid of this wheel and drive on 17, but all of the mechanics I've seen have done everything except remove the squeaky wheel.\n\nAm hoping this post can start a thread or will reach someone kind enough to send me a message pointing me in the right direction or give me some hope or answers. I am desperate for a solution that doesn't involved amputating my finger, but it feels like it is heading that way unfortunately. Is there anyone out there with some information on this? Would amputation make the pain go away or would it just open me up to a new world of hurt?\n\nHelp\n\nP",

There seems to be some evidence to support each of those 3 scenarios. \n\nBased on my research, the main things that concern me are that:\n\n* It is considered alternative therapy, and \"It's not FDA approved, and most studies have found no scientifically-provable benefits.\"\n* I've read at least one NIH article which talks about a case of a person experiencing spinal cord injury due to the needle.  Extremely rare, but it happened.\n\nIf folks have some knowledge about Prolotherapy for neck, I'd love to hear.  Thank you.",

    "text": "It has been almost 10 years since I made [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/2jrmv6/joint_pain_but_blood_work_shows_up_clear_wtf/) as a 17 year old trying to figure out what might be wrong with myself regarding extreme chronic pain. I got sick at 16 and am about to turn 27 . Over the years I have consistently received occasional comments on that thread and numerous messages asking for a followup to see if I could help folks with their own journey, I think that post must show up on a lot of Google searches. The past few messages that I've gotten have been folks asking how I am doing. I am here to provide an update on that as well as give some input on some of the stuff I have dealt with. \n\nLife. Life has changed a lot and I want to provide some info on what diagnoses I ended up with as well as cover some info on ME/CFS (chronic fatigue syndrome) which is a diagnosis I received a long time ago but the severity and functions of the disease were even more unknown at the time than they are now. My blood work is still coming back normal most of the time (occasional positive ANA test which I am told is normal, but many of my doctors over time have mentioned that this does not rule out autoimmune issues on its own) so that part hasn't changed. I also want to say a bit about navigating this stuff as a teen and young adult because I know there will inevitably be a few of those folks reading this post. \n\nDiagnosis/Diagnoses. I ended up with several diagnoses. The first two things that I was diagnosed with were fibromyalgia AND Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (which these days we call ME/CFS). A few years later I got tested for neuropathy (I can't remember what it's called but they stick needles in your joints and zap you) and tested positive for small and large fiber neuropathy in my legs, feet, and hands. I went a while without any diagnoses, just coasting along, but my pain started getting really bad about 5 years ago and when my pain specialist started looking deeper into things on his own time he ended up coming up with a theory that I might be struggling with hEDS (hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome). About a year later I was formally diagnosed with it thanks to awesome advocacy and research on his part and his willingness to work alongside my rheumatologist. I moved to Colorado from Texas a few years ago and my psychiatrist ended up diagnosing me with ADHD and referred me for an Autism (ASD) evaluation and I got diagnosed with that as well. I still am diagnosed with fibromyalgia and treated for it. The ME/CFS is probably what had me out of action when this post was made, but it's been almost 10 years ago and I made this post during what I consider to be a pretty traumatic part of my life so my memory is fuzzy. Of all of my health issues and diagnoses, ME/CFS is what is really ruling over my life at this point and the other stuff is mostly managed. I have had mono many times over the past 11 years and I believe it is what triggered my ME/CFS as a teen and continued to make it worse. In 2023 I had some sort of illness that put me in bed for about a month. I wouldn't be shocked if it was mono, but at this point in time I don't bother going to get tested for it because they aren't gonna be able to help me out with it. I had Covid in November 2023 for the first time and it basically flipped my life upside down as the illness earlier in the year had thrown my ME/CFS off and I was having a hard time but Covid basically has rendered me mostly bedbound and I don't get to leave the house very often because my ME/CFS is so bad right now. My ME/CFS has gone into remission for various stretches of time over the past 11 years and while Covid seems to be particularly bad about making the symptoms of the disease worse, I have 11 years of experience giving me some optimism that I will get a little bit better with time.\n\nNow I want to talk a bit about navigating chronic pain and health issues as a teenager and young adult, though if you're a parent or caretaker reading this I think you might still take away some good advice/input from this. As a teen and young adult you are going to be told that you are faking it, or that you're exaggerating it, or that you're too young to be dealing with such issues. It will get really tiring and you might find yourself wanting to give up. Do not ever ever ever be afraid to seek different opinions from different doctors. Research your conditions and symptoms *extensively* whenever you can and find a doctor that is open minded to hearing what you have to say, because an open minded doctor is going to consider your thoughts and things you've been looking into as they will be aware that you know your own symptoms better than anyone else. If you end up with an ME/CFS diagnosis make sure that the doctor is not referring you to a therapist, psychiatrist, and ignore them if they tell you to exercise. ME/CFS was considered to be a psychiatric disease when I got my diagnosis before this post was made (we just called it Chronic Fatigue Syndrome back then but several years back my primary care doctor affirmed that it is ME/CFS and there is no confusion) and even today I still get occasional *very bad* advice from medical providers who have no clue what they are talking about because they haven't read up on the disease, which has unfortunately has become a common long term symptom with Covid that is often debilitating. \n\nSchool. I dropped out of high school not super long after my original post was made which led to an improvement in my conditions and symptoms. I have met a bunch of folks with similar experiences. This paragraph is my own opinion and it won't apply for every individual, but school was a huge drag on my mental health before the physical health factored in and I knew that I didn't need to go because I was rarely learning anything new due to the fact that I like learning about anything, everything on my own time. When my health finally got bad enough that I couldn't get out of bed (likely experiencing PEM from the ME/CFS, just didn't know at the time) I was left with no choice but to stop going to school. I had dreamed of finishing high school but it just wasn't possible. I spent a while getting better and studying for my GED using free practice exams on the Texas GED website which are basically the actual tests from a year or two prior. The exam changes yearly to prevent cheating but a smart kid can just use the past few year's tests online to practice and get an idea on their strengths and weaknesses to study before going in for the real tests. I got my GED a few days after I turned 18. I did try taking some college courses but it didn't work out and at this point in time college is so expensive that even though I want to go really badly, there is zero chance I would make enough money off a degree to pay back the loans, so my current thought at this point is that if I can ever afford to pay out of pocket for college, I'll do it, but for now I am doing what I can in life without going into debt that would literally ruin me financially. \n\nWork. Chronic pain didn't effect work too much. ME/CFS is what has dictated my ability (or lack of ability) to work over the years. I can't work anymore but I did manage to sneak in a cumulative 2 years of work before it became totally impossible to keep going. Working always caused my ME/CFS to flare up and was never ever sustainable. But I tried. I really did. I can't work a normal job now, but I am currently building a business that I can operate from home with help from my wife who is totally on board with it. \n\nPositives. This post is kind of dreadful to read, but it's almost 10 years worth of updates and I haven't brushed up on some of the great things I have experienced in life in the past 10 years. I spent a lot of time working with my therapist to learn how to be okay with the fact that I am disabled and have to navigate life this way, but after a bunch of CBT I do have a different outlook on life and tend to be an optimist even if it annoys other people. I don't have the time to think about the negatives of life because self loathing doesn't really accomplish anything for me. I have built up some hobbies that I can do on my laptop, iPad, phone, or within my apartment. I play video games online with folks and spend a lot of time on discord voice chat to avoid getting lonely. I definitely struggle with depression pretty often, especially during the summer, but I have a good mental toolset to keep myself going and it's been working for almost 10 years. I have made a ton of music, gotten thousands of plays on it, I have played a decent amount of video games, I got married, I moved from Texas to Colorado and have paradise in my backyard for the days/weekends that I feel good enough to go spend some time in one of the mountain towns with my family. I could probably make another post about how I have navigated marriage for over 3 years as someone with health issues, but I don't really know if folks want to hear about that. I guess it'll be another post if someone asks me about it. Your takeaway from this should be that it is still possible to enjoy life once you learn how to be okay with your pain/other conditions and focus on the positives you have, regardless of how many or how few there might be. \n\nI hope that this is a useful update and if there is anything I have missed covering that you're curious about please ask or send a DM and I'll add it to this post. If you've been brought here by Google or Reddit search a long time after I've posted about this, you can still ask as I plan on taking this Reddit account to the grave, and that's not happening for a long while if I have anything to say about it.",

    "text": "**TL;DR:**\u00a0I've been taking a supplement for years that I never realized may be helping to control my pain. Ran out of it and noticed a huge difference.\n\n--\n\nLet me preface by stating that this is not medical advice. You should talk to your doctor about taking medications and supplements.\n\nFor years, I've been taking a supplement with the active ingredient: nicotinamide riboside (NR). NR is a form of vitamin B3. I won't mention the specific brand I take because I'm not here to promote anything.\n\nNR is used to elevate NAD+ levels, which is suspected to reduce cellular aging and fatigue. Recently, I completely ran out because my shipment got lost in the mail.\n\nWithin a couple days of not taking it, my pain levels shot through the roof. I could hardly get up or move. My nerves felt like they were on fire. It was not an unfamiliar feeling \u2014 it was almost as if my body was remembering how it felt in my 20s (a feeling that drove me to accept opioid therapy for 8 years before I finally took myself off of it).\n\nI wondered if there may be some correlation between my supplement running out and this oddly reminiscent pain. So, I ordered more and began taking it again, making sure not to review any research yet (in effort to avoid any placebo effect). I was pleasantly surprised to find that within a few days, I felt \"normal\" again. Still in pain, but I could at least move around without crying in agony. I felt like \"now\" me, not \"20s\" me.\n\nThat's when I finally dove into some research and found a multitude of studies linking NR to nerve pain relief. Bear in mind, these are all rodent studies. The research is very preliminary, but intriguing nonetheless.\n\nI have recently taken myself entirely off opioid therapy. While I'm looking to start the right SNRI drug soon, right now, my pain is completely unmedicated. I can't help but wonder if the NR supplement may be helping to make my existence more bearable.\n\nIf you google this to do your own research, make sure to note that nicotinamide is NOT the same as niacinamide (search engines will come up with results for both since they're both types of B vitamins).\n\nHere are some resources I found:\n\n[New Scientist - NR might treat chronic pain](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2401405-a-type-of-vitamin-b3-might-treat-chronic-pain-related-to-inflammation/)\n\n[Science Daily - NR prevents nerve pain caused by cancer drugs](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/02/170223151101.htm)\n\n[Science Daily - NR improves walking for patients with chronic leg disease](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/06/240618115327.htm)\n\n[NIH - NR relieves peripheral neuropathy in rats](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7508763/)\n\n[Science Advances - What is NR?](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adi4862#sec-3)\n\nHas anyone else tried taking a nicotinamide supplement? What kind of effects have you noticed, if any?\n\n--\n\n**Edit:** Many people are leaving comments asking me to DM them with the name of the brand I'm taking.  If you'd like that information, please just DM me. It's easier. The mods don't want brands included on the post. Ultimately, there are many brands that make this supplement; I'm sure they're all great.",

My pain Dr gives tons of B12 injections, and when Medicaid audited him and questioned those injections he was able to provide them with enough research that they decided they were justified for 100% of those patients. Seems like the research on all this stuff is progressing lately. \n\nI just saw a new neurologist to try to find the cause of the burning pain in the soles of my feet that started about 18 months ago. Along with a nerve conduction study and the usual blood work for diabetes and B12, she also ordered tests for several other B vitamins and some early indicators for deficiencies that I've never been tested for in my decades of undiagnosed nerve pain. They messed up and told me I didn't have to fast for it though, so I wonder if I should wait to try this supplement until I find out if she wants to repeat that blood work.",

It also sucks because it\u2019s the only thing that really helps my pain and brain, i\u2019m tired of overusing it, it\u2019s like i don\u2019t even want to be high i just want to stop hurting. \n\nmy rheumatologist is also a POS and doesn\u2019t give a fat fuck about me, came in last time for a follow-up that he requested i had, didn\u2019t know why i was there and thought i was having pain in my hands (it\u2019s in my back) so #awesome",

    "text": "I am a 33yr old female(relatively healthy weight 127 at 5\u20195\u201d) who\u2019s suffered from chronic pain in my lower back region going down my R leg all the way to the foot for the last 10 years. I spent several years seeing 4 different docs for this issue w/o a proper diagnosis. During that time they did MRIs on my lower back and hip w/o any contrast that didn\u2019t explain the pain I was experiencing. I also had a couple of nerve conduction studies on that leg showing that I have peroneal neuropathy of my right leg, but didn\u2019t explain why I had pain from the my back down my thigh. \n\nAfter these tests, my doctors came to the conclusion that my pain was psychological and recommended that I go see a psychiatrist for it. \nAt the time I began to doubt myself and wonder if that were true because the pain began right after my boyfriend of 10yrs passed away, but as time went on the pain only became worse and worse. I began doing my own research and found that hip labral tears explained all my symptoms. This usually cannot be found on MRIs w/o contrast, so I demanded that test and\u2026 I was right!\n\nI\u2019m frustrated that not one of these docs ordered this w/o me saying something! I essentially diagnosed myself. The tear was severe and I had a bone abnormality that needed to be shaved down and the tear repaired. I was a dog walker at the time and walked many miles every day on this injury for years. After my surgery some pain returned and another MRI showed that I also had tendinosos(which becomes chronic when not treated quickly, like the several years), yet my doc failed to even mention that I had this. It was only when I read the report and again researched this that I learned what it was and why I still have pain.  I was shrugged off with an \u201cidk\u201d from the doc who has still never said I have this or has given any treatments for it. \n\nIf all that wasn\u2019t bad enough, after continuing to have pain in the R leg, now the L is painful. I again demanded an MRI on the L hip and recently just found a out that there is a tear on the L side w/ a bone abnormality as well. This pain has affected every aspect of my life (sleep, work, social, mental, etc.).\n\nThroughout all of this, the hardest part was feeling like I can\u2019t trust my docs and that they just didn\u2019t care/believe me! I\u2019ve done EVERYTHING to manage the pain (yoga/exercise, patches/topicals, supplements, muscle relaxers, massages, & PT 12x), but I still struggle every day. \n\nHas anyone else experienced this level of negligence? I feel like the best years of my life were stolen and that I will struggle the rest of my life. ",

They did an MRI and told me I had degenerative disc disease that was deforming my spine and that my spine was compressing my spinal cord (cervical kyphosis). I then had to wait 6 months to see a neurosurgeon. I need to have my all cervical discs removed and replaced. It\u2019s crazy. You need an MRI of your spine. Chances are something is wrong there.

        "text": "I don't know where you live, so I don't know the availability of this treatment, but it's what gave me some of my life back. I attend a hospital based pain clinic where I receive IV ketamine (+lidocaine) infusions. They're not for the faint at heart, they are also not a standard treatment (although I really wish they would be considered a standard), and they can be expensive. I live in Canada, so although they are not free here my provincial government healthcare does pay a large portion of the cost. I pay $35-50 depending on the dose and I go every 8 weeks or so. The government only pays for 6 treatments per year here, and the out of pocket expense is $300. \nKetamine and lidocaine infusions honestly bring my pain from a daily 7/10 to 2-4/10. They usually last me around 3-5 weeks and then by the time 8 weeks is up I'm back up around 6-7/10. This doesn't mean I don't have bad days where my pain is bad, I definitely still have those days, but they're much fewer and farther between. Ketamine has also been shown to help with mental health struggles and I can confirm that it has definitely helped my mental health. Whether that's because I'm in less pain on a daily basis or because the ketamine has an additional effect, I'm not sure. Probably both.\nIf you can find a clinic that offers something like this, I highly recommend it. I also know it can be very expensive ($1000+/treatment) in some counties, so it may not be possible for you. It may be worth looking into tho.\n\nOther ideas/suggestions:\nTENS machine, I have a personal one for at home that I use. Not perfect, but can be helpful.\nImpact massage gun, honestly helps with muscle pain and I use it for short periods almost every day. \nMedical cannabis, I think you mentioned using oil but try a variety of different products. I was shocked when I discovered transdermal patches which gives a continuous dose over 1-3 days, great for really bad days or post-op pain. Bath bombs and other topical lotions have been wonderful for me. Using a variety of edibles that are different ratios of THC and CBD (even gummies vs chocolates can affect how they work). \nMaking sure that you have a good quality mattress and pillow can make a world of difference. \nOrthotics/braces to make sure that you're supported properly for your physical therapy/exercise sessions.\n\nPersonally I have EDS, so I hope some of these can help. If not, I'm sorry and I hope you find some relief. I know pain can be a difficult thing to deal with. You're not alone, just keep fighting.",

    "text": "I\u2019m frustrated. I\u2019ve had four pain drs. First said I\u2019m fine second diagnosed started treatment and quit so did the third. My fourth is trying to make any excuse that I\u2019m fine. My lower lumbar hurts it\u2019s a 6-8 everyday and I get no relief. I also fractured my tailbone which is healed but left me with tailbone joint arthritis it even pops like the bones rub together. I\u2019ve had an injection for it but the Dr wouldn\u2019t talk about getting another one even though it lasted months and up till three weeks ago it was pain free. \n\nA couple weeks ago I had my second EMG a nerve conduction test. They are painful to me. After the test I asked the neurologist if the results were the same as last year he said yes it\u2019s mild but it\u2019s still there. I have numbness and tingling in my thigh and foot on the right side I have a pinched nerve in my S1.\n\nFollow up phone call with my dr today went nowhere. He said that because my calf showed no interruption it wasn\u2019t bad. I told him multiple times throughout the phone call that my area of my back with the most pain was that S1 area it\u2019s also sensitive to touch. He said there\u2019s nothing to do. He stated I probably have the spine I did at 17 years old and I\u2019m 45 and should consider myself lucky. \n\nI\u2019m being sent for a follow up MRI I\u2019m just waiting to be called to make the appointment. My last MRI radiology report states, slight bulge with subarticular stenosis. My second pain Dr did have me do a nerve block to see if I could move onto an ablation in the L4 L5 area. The nerve block was a success but my Dr quit and my third Dr didn\u2019t go along with her plan he had other ideas. \n\nI may just have to deal with this for the rest of my life with no medical intervention. I\u2019ve exhausted all options for pain drs I already go two hours to see the one I have. I appreciate the phone visits cause car rides cause pain. This fourth Dr has never laid his hands on me checking where I\u2019m in pain. My first in person visit was him telling me I\u2019m fine. I walked into the appointment using a walker with a seat and had to get up and down from the chair due to pain. Yet he just sent me to another nerve test and even told me he looked at my knee scans and said nothing was wrong there that my orthopedic was wrong.i have arthritis in all three compartments of my knee and my patella slips, I\u2019ve had to pop it back myself a couple times and it\u2019s caused me to fall multiple times. \n\nI am near a 100 pound weight loss I did it with no exercise. In the 190s I tried slow ten min walks on my treadmill worked up to 20 min walks. I went into a flare up and was having a lot of pain. I cut it into 2 ten min slow walks a day but that made it worse. I\u2019ve since put the treadmill away. I no longer use store scooters just my cane or walker. That\u2019s my way of being a little more active. I\u2019m so tired of pain. ",

    "title": "How long did it take for you to get accustomed to Lyrica/Pregabalin and/or Neurotin/Gabapentin?",
    "text": "Greetings,\n\nThis is my first year dealing with GABA medication. I'm diagnosed with:\n\n- Diffuse chronic pain (unlocalized, suspected to be neuropathic)\n\n- Migraines\n\n- IBS-D\n\n- Social Anxiety and overthinking\n\n\n\nDiffuse chronic pain, anxiety and overthinking goes hand-in-hand. For every year with chronic illnesses, the toll on my mental well-being feels like it's getting worse.\n\n  \nBy far the most effective treatment has been Tramadol ER. But after being on it daily (100 mg x 2-3 times per day) for 9 months, there was the need to increase the dosage, which was expected, but instead of increasing, my doctor wanted me to try other options.\n\nStarted with Venlafaxine/Effexor, which made me feel extremely apathetic, and I didn't manage to stay on it for more than 3-4 weeks. It also destroyed my sleep. Switched to Duloxetine/Cymbalta, which worked better, but still the same trouble with feeling apathetic, no joy or motivation, and still affected my sleep.\n\n  \nI have previously, for migraines, tried amitriptyline, from what I recall it wasn't as bad as Venlafaxine or Duloxetine regarding feeling apathetic or affecting my sleep. But it made my heart go above 120 bpm while idle, over 90 bpm during sleep, and I got the worst nightmares triggering the worst migraines I've ever had. And it had some hangover effect, I would always feel extremely drowsy in the morning.\n\n  \nThen all of a suddenly my doctor pulls Neurotin/Gabapentin out of her sleeve. This helped my social anxiety and overthinking more than anything I've ever tried. Instant relief, even more so than Tramadol ER.\n\nTolerance builds extremely quickly, much more so than Tramadol. At 200 mg 3-4 times per day I had to stop due to abdominal pain.\n\n  \nNow I'm on Pregabalin/Lyrica, and I've been so for 1 month. Started on 25 mg 3-4 times per day, and now I'm on 50 mg 3-4 times per day, the last increase happened 14 days ago, and I'm feeling I will need another bump not so far into the future.\n\n\n\nI'm wondering what others have experienced when using GABA medications? I'm not entirely sure whether I should stay with Pregabalin/Lyrica or not. I see a lot of people telling how hard it is to stop.\n\nSo far I'm torn if I enjoy it or not. It does work, but it has it's drawback. I have periods feeling down/depressed like I didn't use to. If this is the Pregabalin, or just my mental state in general is hard to tell. I do feel very dependent on it. You notice very quickly when you haven't taken your dose. I think this is why I often wake up feeling worse than I normally do, as I find Pregabalin somewhat activating/stimulating, so I can't take it directly before bed, otherwise it will take me another 2-3 hours falling a sleep, compared to if I don't. I suspect this stretch of 9-11 hours between my last dose, and my morning dose, creates a slight withdrawal.\n\nI had the same issue with Tramadol IR, which is why I was put on Tramadol ER to combat this. But the Tramadol withdrawal symptoms wasn't anywhere near as annoying as the Pregabalin ones. My anxiety spikes like crazy.\n\n\n\nMy biggest question is. Does any of this change over time? From my experience, most side-effects from medication will normally subside after just a few days, and at two weeks tops. But things affecting you mentally tends to be more difficult and confusing.\n\nCurrently my biggest annoyances are brain-fog, lack of being able to form sentences at times, slow-thinking, and the periods where I suddenly feel more down than usual, and periods of feeling fatigued and weak.\n\n\n\nWhen considering whether to stay on Pregabalin or not, a better understanding of how this is most likely going to play out in the long run is essential to make the best judgement.\n\nA lot of people combine TCA/SSRI/SNRI/NDRI and GABA, but that's mostly because people taking these meds tends to also be depressed. As I have responded poorly to every TCA and SNRI I've tried, I'm very skeptical about combining.\n\n\n\nStaying on Tramadol ER was easy, as it didn't have any noticeable side-effects.",

Feel free to stop reading here and share your wisdom! The rest is just details about my condition.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since my chronic pain condition flared up (for the first time in 8 years), triggering worsening depression, then had a whole new slew of gastrointestinal symptoms start 4 months ago. The chronic pain is again in *remission* but everything else is a mess and I\u2019m trying to figure out how to find joy again. I do believe my health will get better one day. I will eventually get diagnosis and treatment for the current issues, but it could be another year or more. I feel like a failure since I can\u2019t get the doctors to take me seriously and I feel like a failure for not being able to focus on the good in my life and be happy instead of being overwhelmed and distraught over the health issues. \n\nI can\u2019t digest food, I\u2019ve lost 20lbs in 4 months (without having the weight to lose), I don\u2019t have energy - I can\u2019t exercise, I get lightheaded just standing, daily chores, cooking, etc. are a struggle. I\u2019m off work. I can\u2019t get approved for disability. I live alone. I\u2019m depleting my savings and will soon have to rely on my parents.\n\nI\u2019ve had every test possible for the gastrointestinal issues and the only thing coming up abnormal is an ovarian cyst, but no one believes the cyst could cause the digestive issues so I\u2019m considered low priority and an elective surgery, which means likely a year or more. I\u2019m looking into out of country/private pay options for the surgery but it\u2019s hard to fathom spending tens of thousands of dollars for it out of pocket. \n\nThere is some good. Some days I can manage a walk so I head to the ocean and sit and stare for a while. I\u2019ve started reading regularly again. My apartment gets really nice afternoon sunshine. I videochat my parents almost daily so our relationship is getting closer. I have a couple friends who have been great at being there for me when they can despite their limited capacity. Still, I spend every morning lying in bed for hours with nausea and dread, I cry at least a few hours a day, I\u2019m scared, I think I want to make a career shift but I don\u2019t have the energy to do that.  I don\u2019t want to move across the country back in with my parents because I love the city where I live but I don\u2019t have a support system here. I feel like I\u2019m failing at adulting. I feel useless and pathetic. I just want to be useful again. ",

Chronic pain may limit us from achieving our personal goals, but it doesn\u2019t take away our ability to help others succeed. *Meaning* gives rise to **joy**. In many ways, it\u2019s like how mothers can selflessly dedicate themselves to their children overcoming challenges and struggles, yet finding only joy and love. I probably know what you are going to say, that you are too unwell to help others, how can you help others when you can't even help yourself. But look what you have already done, you calling your parents daily, surely that must bring them so much joy. \n\nWhat gives rise to **hope** is impermanence; everything is in constant flux, and change brings hope. However, we shouldn't focus on blind hope but on hope rooted in action\u2014believing that a cause will lead to an effect. Think of actions you can take to help with your illness, actions for your mental and physical well-being, actions to strengthen your bonds with others, and actions to reach your goals. Focus on these actions and on planting seeds, but don\u2019t get caught up in the effects or results\u2014just *do* for now. \n\nI had to quit a good paying job that I went to university for five years for because I knew it will continue to ruin my body. My savings were dwindling down as I slowly cut down my hours due to the pain. I had to move to another country and in with my parents as I can no longer look after myself. Its true when they say when you've hit rock bottom that the only way is up. I had 78k in student loan debt then and broke up with my then girlfriend of five years. I gave up on all my then dreams and goals, and just focused my health. Doing what I should be doing for all areas of my life, now I am married for 3 years, my savings is on par with people my age and my debt is now manageable at 28k. Remember that life\u2019s impermanence means change is possible. By taking action, however small, you can plant the seeds for a brighter future. Good luck.",

    "text": "Basically I've been on Opioids/pregabalin for 3 years and they are the only thing that keeps my pain down. \n\nIm on 360mg dihydrocodeine and 150mg pregabalin.\n\nI'm 21 and cant work. I can't go to Church to practice my religion. I spend most of my time in bed and with the medication I have I can maybe walk around a park for a hour. \n\nBut I need to work. I can't keep relying on the small amount of disability money I get. It's not enough to pay my way and I'm sick and tired of basically leaching off my dad. I want a life, or atleast to be able to work and pay him more for the amount of time he's spent helping me. \n\nBeing unable to do much is killing me. I can't do the things important to me. \n\nI have no social life because of it. I'm always In too much pain to socialise and as a result am basically trapped away in my room. It's mentally draining.\n\nThe doctors in the UK hate medication. They are lazy and incompetent tbh. My tolerance has made it so what I'm on work less than it used to. I need a dosage increase or just a stronger med. I used to get diazepam aswell on top, which helps a ton. But they forced me off that and are now trying to force me off opioids aswell.\n\nIf they force me off meds I'd have nothing. I already spend enough time resting, I don't want to extend that to resting forever. I honestly, would have probably ended it without the meds. I'm just useless and I hate the pain. \n\n\nI've had to resort to buying meds, but can only get a day or 2 worth a month. \n\nWith oxy and diazepam together I've been able to spend nearly the whole day pain free. But it's so hard to get, and it's so expensive, I can't afford it. \n\nIf a doctor could just prescribe a stronger opioid like oxy to take daily instead of me having to take 12\u00d7 DHC (which barley works anymore) a long with a benzodiazepine like diazepam to take say 2-3 days a week I could work again. \n\n\nPains ruining my life. As much as I hate being on meds (the withdrawals are evil), I also hate being in pain. \nI'd rather be stuck on medication and have a life. But doctors think backwards. \n\nAfter 3 years I've come to the realisation that I can't do it without meds. And that I'd rather be on them for life and love a little than not being on them and not being able to look after myself. \n\nI wish doctors could understand. They just see these types of medications and instantly think of drug addicts and getting high. I had a doctor tell me I'm basically a heroin addict for being on them. But they can't provide a better option. \n\nSee the thing is. I've never turned down a treatment. I've tried every med they've thrown at me. And every physical treatment aswell. These meds are the only thing that works and that's annoying because they are also the most difficult thing to get.\n\nIf anyone knows if private doctors in the UK would be likely to prescribe anything better than what I'm on please lmk. \n\n",

You can also claim UC and LWCRA too, and PIP, this should work out around 700 per month, maybe slightly less at your age until your 25, and then PIP is around 290/500pm. Some clinics do discounts for those on disability benefits. \n\nI'm only a few months into the benzo/opiates/pregamblin journey and can 100% vouch that a small dose of benzos at night can give me most of the day pain free, reducing my opidate intake, and my pregamblin dose. When I introduced dizapem originally, I was able to go down my pregamblin dose and went many days without codiene. Using only tramadol at night when the pain is worse (I've got a nerve injury in my pelvis, left leg so walking, sitting, standing all make it worse so it's more manageable small doses of resting/activity and feeling some pain is always going to happen daily). \n\nCannabis has a similar effect for me as benzos. Atm I've been through a rough month minis flares and 2 super flares, one that resulted in being back in hospital. and have been using alongside tramadol/dizapem and pregamblin, but prior to September wild flares, I was down to only paracetamol during day, increasing walking distance, even surfing and driving some days with pregamblin, tramadol and dizapem at night when the pain actually started to set in, with THC. I felt like I got my life back and felt my body getting stronger. But mine is still being managed conservatively currently with physio/rehab on side with idea to start weaning off. Everytime I've tried so far though I've ended up either being unable walk/dress/housebound or in hospital. \n\nI find it wild we can prescribe benzos to people with anxiety disorder for years without fuss but for muscle spasms it's like have you tried doing mindfulness? Right. \n\nCould also consider going to mainland Europe for treatment. They can authorize scripts via some UK online pharmacy's or give you enough of a dose to bring over.

    "text": "I need some advice! I'm a chronic pain patient and had been on Oxycodone for about 5 years. My doctor wanted me to try Suboxone for pain and I was open to it. I met with a pain pharmacist and we tweaked and adjusted the Suboxone until it worked fairly well for me.\n\n I started to get dizzy when I would stand up, every time. It became worse and worse, I was almost blacking out, seeing stars and I thought I was having a heart problem (I am a congenital heart defect patient)  until I looked up Suboxone side effects. Orthostatic hypotension caught my eye. There it was, I found the problem. I talked to my Pain Pharmacist about it and we tried removing ALL of my blood pressure medications which didn't help. Eventually the pain pharmacist recommended to my doctor that I be switched back to Oxycodone. I went back on Oxycodone and everything has been fine for about 1 year. \n\nThen, I noticed that the oxycodone wasn't working as long as it had been, so I mention it to my doctor fairly casually and he says \"oh you should be getting much better coverage, I'll have you meet with the pain pharmacist again and I'll have a couple options for you.\" Well, I met with the Pain Pharmacist again and guess what? The only option he gave was Suboxone, my doctor wanted me to try it again! So now, I'm on it again and I'm afraid I will actually pass out and fall and hit my head. I tell the Pain Pharmacist my concerns and I asked if it were possible to do some type of hybrid treatment to lessen the suboxone. I also told her the current Suboxone dose wasn't helping my pain enough so I asked if we could increase the dose because my pain levels weren't good and I had no other choice but to ask to increase the Suboxone despite the orthostatic hypotension issue. So then the pain Pharmacist tells me she thinks I'm addicted and have opioid use disorder and they want to have me see a psychiatrist! This all came from me just saying my Oxycodone wasn't lasting as long! What is going on here?! Anybody know? It's crazy. Isn't it illegal for a doctor to put you back on something that he knows will make you pass out? Are they just trying to put the problem on another department and label me an addict? I really don't understand, I have major health issues and I'm treated like this?  I'm scared.",

But they should know enough to tell you that your pain pharmacist is full of beans. They are no more more qualified to diagnose addiction than a psychiatrist is qualified to diagnose Lupus. You should have insisted they keep their suboxone. Its not for pain anyhow, and a pharmacist should know that better than anyone. The opioid part is a drug called buprenorphine. Its a lousy pain drug because of a functional dose ceiling. Once you max the dose, its not going to have any further analgesic effect, no matter how much buprenorphine you take. Great for opioid use disorder, but it makes a sad pain medication, particularly for severe pain. \n\nYour pharmacist should stick to judgments they are qualified to make. JUst what addictive behavior did you demonstrate? Are you obsessed with your medication? If they had pain they'd be a little obsessed with what works best, too. Thats not addictive behavior. You have a problem needing early medication refills every month? Trade grandma's jewels for a bottle of pills recently? Your pharmacist doesnt have a clue what the hell theyre talking about. Hopefully this psychiatrist will tell them exactly that. And if they think youre an addict, theyll put you on Suboxone. It just doesnt make sense. \n\nI had that happen once, they wanted me to see someone for an evaluation. It was a 6 week wait for their psychiatrist, so I went to the county methadone clinic for evaluation. They bitched out the pain doc (it was actually a PA) for wasting everyones time.  Then I called the PA later that afternoon saying they were being replaced as pain management. It was a decent afternoon in many ways.\n\nYou need to keep in mind, no matter how nice these medical provider may seem and even if they are truly since about being helpful, taking a controlled substance puts a target on your back. It makes you undesirable as a patient, even if doctors know the truth behind this opioid bullshit and more hoax than crisis to it. Prescribing controlled substances puts a target on the doctors back. The DEA wants the disposition of every dose of certain drugs accounted for. Theyre not plutonium. Even if the DEA isnt part of your government, I assure you they influence medical treatment immensely, all over the world. They want peoples attention on Rx drugs and not their 40 year failure to address the wholesale poisoning of street drugs.\n\nThere's a lot of reasons you shouldnt have been put on Suboxone to begin with. Your experiences just reinforce the idea that this is a bad drug for you. Any buprenorphine based drug is going to present the same issues (butrans, subutex, belbuca, etc).\n\nI couple things, real fast. Youre mistaking being a shitty doctor for committing a crime. Malpractice is a very high bar. If the surgery came out as expected, it might not even be malpractice if they got the wrong limb. Its a high bar. The other thing is your pain pharmacist is probably not a medical doctor, but a doctor of pharmacy. You dont write like a pharmacy, Ill bet you dont look like one, either. Medical advice should come from medical doctors, not \"chemists\". Just because they can \"whip up a hell of a potion\", it doesnt mean they know what theyre doing or talking about when it comes to your body. Its not much different than calling a chiropractor \"doc\", its friendly, but it doesnt make them a medical doctor by any stretch. I'd feel safer with medical advice from a Vet, at least they have a degree of humane empathy for the animals THEY treat...",

Im currently on tramadol, pregamblin, codiene (during daytime) and dizapem at night for muscle relaxants for muscle spasms and bladder issues caused by them due to peripheral neuropathy caused by potential fibrosis from a large pelvic hematoma that was left unmanaged by hospital and I was discharged with no physical follow up - they also caused the hematoma. \n\nBeing the NHS, I went through delays with just getting doctors to believe I was in pain and needed priority in getting appointments. I went from surfing, running, cycling, running on a weekly basis, as well as running my own business part time, travelling frequently, being very practical (fixing up my own car, sewing/repairing my own clothes etc) to immobile overnight. It was like my world ended. I lost my new job as a tutor, I can't access my home (top floor apartment with no lift), I rely on state benefits, I can't see my friends who are scatted all over country/abroad due to my former lifestyle. I've used a lot of my savings that were supposed to be for IVF (I'm also subfertile due to Endo I had the botched surgery for), to pay for private consultations/MRI. \n\nThings are now progressing and I saw a pain clinic today, but quite frankly and here is my rant, I AM sick of doctors pill shaming. Every appointment I'm told how bad it is that I'm on x,y,z at my young age, but they have no alternatives to offer. It's widely accepted by everyone managing my care that my surgeon messed up, but no one wants to directly say that and due to the hospital withholding my notes, I've been left to suffer in pains for months, with my GPs only option to prescribe whatever meds would keep me from hospital admissions (which also happened due to pain). The last time my GP tried to take me off one of these pain medications, I lost the ability to get myself on/off the toilet, and dress myself,  it was agreed until a treatment plan was in place, we wouldn't remove them, there isn't one currently, except be in pain and hope it gets better. The pain management team  are worried opiates are causing constipation, despite my bowels only being impacted during extreme flares, but don't consider how many health issues come from not being able to feed myself, walk, socialize, or do any type of physio excercise because i cant move. They keep telling me how I'm too young to be on these drugs, ignoring the fact I'm too young at 31 to also be immobile. \n\nAfter the pain clinic trying to suggest today that they don't want to do any sort of nerve blocks for the neuropathic pain because I'm making very slow, but positive recovery, with good days become more frequent, although pain days are still the majority, they also suggested we should try removing me off some medications. I was not happy. Prior to getting on pain meds, I became suicidal from the pain. Id started to lose the ability to walk, and couldn't get around. I was missing birthdays, weddings, and feeling isolated. On top of this, I literally just spent the past 3 days unable to sleep due to pain being awake til 4/5am until I gave in and took a sleeping pill. At my consultants suggestion to reduce the pain meds, I told him that the pain makes me want to die, and not having this pain (even when its only taking the edge of) is the only thing keeping me alive. I said I was already not taken meds on good pain days, except in the evenings when it's unavoidable, but I can't function, sleep and am in agony.\n\nWe've now agreed that I'm in \"control\" of when I start to reduce them and have now just been encouraged to do so when I feel up to it on good days, with a review set for 2 months to see how I've got on. I don't even care at this point if they think I have addiction issues or dependency. I probably do, be i just like being able to walk, and wash myself and dress myself, so sue me. I know I've come on this page only twice and both times it's been to rant but seriously can doctors please stop with the pill shaming now, especially when they don't have any other solutions but be in pain until we hope you recover???? \n\nGreat one. \n\n",

I\u2019d been taking it for 18 months or so when they stopped it. Might\u2019ve been a bit longer. \n\nCodeine wise I got cut off at closer to the two year point due to some other interactions that made it necessary. I got no say in it. Withdrawal from daily max dose to nothing was really rough. \n\nI\u2019m surprised they\u2019ve given you Tramadol and Codeine at the same time. My most recent post op pain relief was Tramadol rather than codeine and they were very explicit about not mixing it with any OTC cocodamol or anything. \n\nI get paracetamol and naproxen now which admittedly doesn\u2019t do enough really but it is at least \u201csome\u201d pain relief. \n\nBowel and bladder issues will be being made worse by opiate use as they do tend to cause more constipation. You\u2019ll notice a difference when you come off. Granted continence issues might not be top of your list but they\u2019ll also be thinking about that. They\u2019ll also be looking at that in terms of reduced mobility as that contributes too. \n\nI completely get it\u2019s horrible because when the pain is causing the reduced mobility which will definitely also be contributing to some of your issues. This then leads to painkiller use to get more mobile but the painkillers themselves also exacerbate things. \n\nI also completely understand the pain of spending your own money on MRIs and physio to try and get the NHS to do something or move up waiting lists. I\u2019ve had 5 MRIs recently and I had to pay for 2 of them! Worth it though. \n\nThe being young thing I\u2019ve also had being a similar age to you but it\u2019s a double edged sword. I\u2019ve had a few practitioners do the same \u201cyou\u2019re too young to be having these issues\u201d and taking a \u201cso it\u2019s probably not real or at least not the extent you are saying\u201d attitude. But I\u2019ve also had a few saying \u201cyou\u2019re too young to be having these issues, let\u2019s really sort it out\u201d. I think the second camp see the quality of life upside if they can sort this stuff out and get you back to something near what you were. \n\nIt\u2019s difficult to look at anything with a positive outlook when you are in a lot of pain but some of the things you\u2019ll have been told regarding reducing the use of some of the medications will have been with your best interests at heart and not just pushing some kind of agenda. \n\nIf you haven\u2019t already then contacting PALs could be a good idea regarding the problems post op.",

I can't believe they come up with dependency and constipation to justify getting you of opiates. Who gives a shit, really? You are dependent on your opiate. It just means you have to come off it slowly if you do, which shouldn't happen anyway because ir works. And yes, it causes constipation. I take senna pills and it's taken care of. Not to mention 90% of meds cause dependency anyway. And constipation reducing your mobility. Please. Pain from not having opiates reduces mobility.\n\nThis opiate paranoia is ridiculous. They are targeting an efficient medication that actually has pretty good side effect profile. The risk of addiction in pain patients it is negligible. If only they could be with us for days at a time, they would change their minds. For me and many others, opiates are the difference between working or staying at home in bed suffering. I don't think they realize that fully. Also, doctors should base their decisions on research, not DEA induced paranoid news reports",

    "text": "I won my disability case a few months ago (after 3.5 years of delays) and recently signed up for an Aetna Medicare Advantage plan. They keep sending me these condescending letters about the opioids my doctor prescribes me.\n\nI have had multiple failed spinal fusion surgeries. I've tried everything from injections to physical therapy to meditation to treat chronic, debilitating back pain. Nothing works. My primary care doctor, pain management specialist, and therapist who specializes in treating patients with chronic pain are all okay with my treatment plan which involves using low dose opioids to manage my pain. It is the only option we have found that allows me to get up and move around regularly, and I have been on the same dose with no issues since 2019.\n\nBut trying to get the prescriptions filled leaves me frustrated and ashamed. Staff at the healthcare system don't send my requests to my doctors; the electronic systems my doctors are forced to use go down; there are shortages and disruptions in the supply chain; staff at the pharmacy are too busy or disinterested to help; my insurers hold up approvals at the pharmacy; and everyone I ever talk to feels compelled to warn me about the risks of these medications and encourages me to stop taking them.\n\nI'm 50 years old. I can read the newspaper and watch the news. I can speak to healthcare professionals who have warned me about the risks. I am not stupid. I have seen friends and loved ones' lives ruined by these drugs. My doctors and I aren't happy with my condition, but after years of discussion and challenges we have arrived at a plan that works for me.\n\nSo can I please just take the medicine I am prescribed without being made to feel like a fool or a drug addict? Can you maybe direct some of your energy and concern to the monsters who created this epidemic, instead of the patients and victims who have been upended by it? It's hard enough putting on a brave face every day about the lousy hand that was dealt to me. When will people realize that they're only making me feel worse about my situation?",

I started off saying I understand the discussions and stigma of it, and he told me to forget the stigma around it and just talk as if that wasn\u2019t the case. It was refreshing to hear a doctor say that pain medication isn\u2019t bad, and can be helpful when used the right way.

    "text": "I\u2019m 35 years old and have been struggling with chronic pain for over a decade, stemming from a college football injury. Despite undergoing numerous surgeries, consulting countless doctors, and trying various non-traditional treatments, my quality of life remains poor. The pain prevents me from enjoying simple pleasures like traveling, dining out, or spending time with friends. The only thing that provides relief is medication, which helps manage my pain and allows me to live more fully.\n\nHowever, my quality of life is ultimately in the hands of doctors who don\u2019t fully understand the daily challenges I face. My doctor only sees me for a few minutes every 90 days and has no real insight into the extent of my struggles\u2014like the pain of getting out of bed, walking down stairs, or bending to tie my shoes. Because of this, I often avoid social situations to spare others from my limitations and to keep from being seen as someone who constantly complains.\n\nI\u2019ve come to terms with the fact that my pain won\u2019t disappear, and managing it with medication is my best option. Unfortunately, access to the right medication is becoming increasingly difficult due to government regulations on opioid prescriptions, which pressure doctors to prescribe minimal dosages or none at all out of fear of losing their license or facing legal consequences.\n\nThis dependence on a doctor for the next 50-70 years is not sustainable for me. I am starting to explore the possibility of making my own pain medication. People centuries ago created their own remedies before modern pharmaceuticals existed, so I believe there\u2019s hope. This could be valuable not just for chronic pain patients, but also for those in the #prepper or #offgrid living communities.\n\nI\u2019m looking for advice, collaboration, and insights from anyone who has experience or knowledge in this area. I want to emphasize that my goal is strictly for personal use, not to break laws or produce medication for sale.\n\nI would love to hear your thoughts and connect with like-minded individuals.\n",

    "title": "Accessing Opioids in the U.S. as a Canadian Resident with Complex Medical Needs",
    "text": "**Background:**\n\nI am a Canadian permanent resident currently residing in Norway, dealing with a complex medical condition that requires specialized pain management. Due to financial constraints and the need for family support, I am planning to relocate to Ontario, Canada, as my family is there and unable to relocate to Norway. However, I am concerned about potential challenges in accessing the necessary medications and treatments upon my return to Canada due to the significant limitations in the medical system. Securing a GP can take around 8 months, and obtaining my required medications is going to be a lengthy process. Although I have been approved for medically assisted death in Canada, I still seek adequate pain management to allow me to live with some quality of life while I\u2019m still here\n\n**Current Medications Prescribed in Norway:**\n\n\u2022\tOxycodone (Immediate-release, 10mg, 2-3 times daily)\n\t\u2022\tParacetamol (4 times daily)\n\t\u2022\tOxazepam (25mg, 3 times daily)\n\t\u2022\tBaclofen XR (25mg, 3 times daily)\n\t\u2022\tAmbien (10-20mg at night)\n\t\u2022\tElvanse for ADHD and to counter sedation (30mg, morning and evening)\n\t\u2022\tCetirizine (10mg, 2x a day)\n\t\u2022\tMontelukast (10mg, 2x a day)\n\t\u2022\tCromolyn Sodium (200mg daily)\n\n**For Breakthrough Pain/Emergency Use**\n\n\u2022\tMorphine injections (10mg) administered by a home nurse\n\t\u2022\tFentanyl patches (50-75mcg)\n\t\u2022\tOxyContin (20mg)\n\t\u2022\tValium (10mg)\n\t\u2022\tClonazepam (2mg)\n\t\u2022\tClonidine\n\t\u2022\tAdditional non-narcotic medications\n\t\u2022\tBuprenorphine patches (50mg)\n\n**Challenges in Canada:**\nCanadian customs only permit a one-month supply of Schedule II narcotics, even for patients with terminal conditions. My Norwegian doctors are willing to prescribe a six-month supply to help with the transition, but this is not permitted by Canadian regulations.\n\nOntario has a known shortage of General Practitioners, leading to significant wait times. Walk-in clinics do not prescribe narcotics, and emergency rooms are often overburdened and not suitable for ongoing pain management needs.\n\n**Seeking Advice from U.S. Residents:**\n\nIm trying to find the possibility of accessing the same pain management/medications in the U.S., especially in New York due to its proximity to Ontario.\n\nIf I bring a translated copy of my medical records and a letter from my European and Norwegian specialists who prescribed these medications, is there a way to access my daily medications in the U.S.?\n\nMy partner, who has severe spinal issues, received countless narcotics in the U.S. previously at Mayo Clinic and Cleveland, despite not being a U.S. citizen or resident, but my US friends with health conditions say it\u2019s the hardest country to get opioids in. My partner got everything until he had to beg them that he doesn\u2019t want them. \n\nI am prepared to cover any associated costs, as my primary goal is to manage my pain effectively during this transition period until I secure reliable care in Canada. I\u2019ve been thoroughly evaluated and diagnosed, so I don\u2019t need additional diagnostic work\u2014just continuity of care. Thank you so much for your time and any advice you can offer.",

But even then I'm not sure as I think TSA would have a lot of reg flags going off that it's perhaps trafficking. My other thought would have the doctors fill the 6 months as a one month prescription so it doesn't look like more than 30 days worth. However the quantity might still bite you. As far as getting even some of these prescriptions Ontario would not be a good bet. You'd have slightly better odds in the western provinces (and even then, it wouldn't be all of them \ud83d\ude14) I'm sorry OP but I just don't think there's a way to get those prescriptions here from any doctor.

        "text": "I'm sorry to sound like such a downer, but I don't see any way in the world those meds are going to happen here in the US. You might be lucky to get a fraction of that. \n\nI have been a chronic pain patient for 40+ years. I have a connective tissue disease and have had 80+ surgeries. I was taking #6 OxyContin 80mg and #9 Oxycodone IR 30mg a day. That added up to 1125MME. I was on that dose for over 20 years. But in 2016 the CDC (Centers for Disease Control) issued very restrictive opioid prescribing recommendations that were meant as a guide for general practitioners. That's what started the whole opioid hysteria here in the states. Soon the medical and pharmacy boards in all 50 states issued their own recommendations to align with the CDC. Next the health insurance companies jumped on board and capped the dose of opioids they would cover. Something got lost in the translation because the changes  in prescribing recommendations that were meant as a guideline for general practitioners encompassed ALL providers. The same recommendations that apply to a family doctor apply to a pain management provider. \n\nI mentioned the word \"recommendations\" several times. But these really aren't recommendations at all. The states really can't make laws regarding what medications a doctor can prescribe. But their \"recommendations\" have the same effect. The 2016 CDC prescribing guidelines set forth the following \"suggestions\" that were also initiated by each state. Doses up to 200MME can be prescribed by pain management but only under strict adherence to safety precautions. This has translates into required monthly appointments, urines and random pill counts. Although in one breath they say opioid doses should tailored to each patient, it just doesn't happen. In my own state, those providers who dare to prescribe over these \"recommended\" doses have found themselves under investigation by the state medical board which controls their license to practice. They will inevitably find some problem in the doctor's practice for which they will be disciplined. This has all but stopped prescribing over 200MME. You'll find this to be true in all states.\n\nIt wouldn't matter if I were terminal. Doctors are too afraid of losing their medical licenses to prescribe adequate pain relief. Prior to these changes I volunteered at our church, helped with our small business and kept up the house. \nI'm now prescribed #2 oxycodone 30mg extremed release and #4 oxycodone 15mg immediate release per day equaling 180MME. I am bedridden, but the government is happy with my opioid dose. \n\nOne more issue you're going to run into. Patients here are for the most part forced to choose between their opioids and any benzodiazepines they may be taking. I've never talked to anyone outside of inpatient hospital care that has been allowed to take both at the same time. \n\nBasically, you're going to be forced to make massive cuts in your medications if you're seeking health care in the states. (I hear Canada opioid prescribing isn't much better.)  I saw you were hoping  someone could talk to some providers here and relay your medical history. Your physical condition is irrelevant because of the prescribing limitations that are in place. You would be required to see pain management here in the states and there are waiting lists in most practices. Outside of a passing curiosity, doctors here aren't going to be too interested in what you're currently being prescribed. They didn't care what US doctors had been prescribing to me. It's not going to persuade them to prescribe much, if anything over 200MME. \n\nI'm now taking 16% of my previous opioid dose and there isn't much hope of that changing anytime soon. No physician is willing to put their medical license on the line to prescribe the opioids that would be necessary to resurrect me from the bed bound invalid I have become. My condition is solely due to medication limits. I'm sorry to say it, but you will be destined to the same fate here in the states.\n\nDo you know what your daily MME is? I couldn't calculate it because you didn't list specific doses for the breakthrough pain meds.",

    "text": "I\u2019m a 32 year old male and have had severe chronic SI joint pain for years. I had all the diagnostic tests done, imaging showed significant disc degeneration at l5-s1 with multiple fractures, no changes to SI joints. I\u2019ve had the diagnostic injections done multiple times in both SI joints and facet joints at multiple levels, all with 0% relief. Physical tests did not cause any provocation of pain. Pain did not get better after multiple rounds of physical therapy. The doctor recommended that I have l5-s1 disc replacement saying he\u2019s pretty confident the pain is coming from my disc and not SI joints. So, now I\u2019m six weeks post disc replacement surgery and the pain at times is unbearable. It is worse now than before the surgery. I\u2019ve got new nerve pain going down both legs with constant numbness and burning in both feet. On top of that, the sharp pain in both SI joints is worse as well. I cannot sleep at night because it constantly feels like my feet are on fire. Has anyone else experienced this? I go back to see the doctor tomorrow, and they are fully aware of my current symptoms. I\u2019m very afraid that they are going to tell me that there is nothing they can do or they are going to prescribe more treatments that don\u2019t work. I can\u2019t stand this pain anymore.

    "text": "I\u2019m not okay. And I\u2019ll appreciate any help I can get right now, because I know I will sound like an ungrateful little idiot if I were to share this with anyone else who does not have/has had Chronic Pain..\nAnd I want to apologize in advance to anyone who is currently going through an episode and does not want to read something like this. If you don\u2019t want to, please know, you don\u2019t have to. \n\nI\u2019ve been living with a debilitatingly painful Chronic Back Pain for +7 years now. Every single day, without fail, I\u2019d be in a lot of pain. \u201cA lot\u201d feels like an understatement. It\u2019s been hell, that\u2019s all I have to say about it, and I won\u2019t bore you all with those details, because I\u2019m sure you already get it.\n\nFor the past few weeks to a month, my Chronic Back Pain is suspiciously lower than ever before and I\u2019m having more \u201cgood days\u201d than bad? I just don\u2019t understand why this is suddenly happening... It feels weird. It feels wrong too..\n\nRight now, I\u2019ll say something on here, that I\u2019ve never really told anyone else, due to the fear of being looked at and judged as if I were a crazy person. But here goes..\nAs much as I have died wanting to be rid of this pain, there remains a part of me that always gets scared thinking; \u201cHow I\u2019d live on if and once the pain finally were to go away, some day?\u201d\nI\u2019d feel like an alien in my own body.\nAnd the thought of living a life without being in excruciating pain 24/7 feels too foreign, too strange to me, after all I\u2019ve been through.\nBeing in constant pain has become both my companion and kryptonite.\n\nI guess I\u2019m a hypocrite? \nI really don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on in my mind.. But I\u2019ve unfortunately felt like this for the past couple of years.. \n\nI\u2019ve considered any and everything I could have ever done to finally be done with this kind of life and to not have this much pain. And all I got from these 7 years was more pain, and no diagnosis, whatsoever..\nOnly to come back and claim how I\u2019ve always felt afraid of living a life without Chronic Pain, once again.\nWow.\nIsn\u2019t that sad?\nIs this the power Chronic Pain really has over us? \n\nI\u2019ve brought about some changes in my life for the past 6-12 months. And now I can\u2019t even point fingers at what could be a reason for my back pain acting like the way it is nowadays.\n\nFor context, I\u2019ll still list a few of the new additions to my life/lifestyle below:\n1. I started taking Vitamin B12 and Vitamin D supplements 6 months ago. I was deficient in both.\n2. I was on Muscle Relaxers and NSAIDs the first year of my CP journey, and never took them again on a daily basis because they didn\u2019t do much for my pain.. I\u2019ve been \u201cwillingly\u201d suffering more pain than I needed to, I don\u2019t know why I did that to myself (basically, I\u2019d only take my Muscle Relaxers for plane flights). Due to a recent ankle injury from 2 months ago, my Orthopedic Doctor prescribed me the same medication (on a higher dose) for 2 weeks. Is this a lasting effect of taking that medication for that long? I don\u2019t know\u2026\n3. I tried a new hands-on Physiotherapist (for my ankle injury) but my Physiotherapist mainly treated the major muscle on the top of my leg (his treatment healed my ankle pain after only 4 sessions), and I wonder if the hands-on inadvertently did something for my back too?\n4. I\u2019m currently on a serious journey towards losing more weight. Living with CP severely disrupts our movements, so I started eating cleaner since a year ago (incorporating greens and salads in my diet in addition to the usual unhealthy stuff), but I\u2019ve only strictly been on Keto for the past 2 months.\n5. I also started using a freeze-spray on my back (for the very first time again in 6 years), also about 2 months ago. Although, not sure if it could cultivate a response like this from my back.\n6. I have done over +50 Physiotherapy these past 7 years (this was a different Physiotherapist). Since then, I could not go even 1 day without exercising because that 1 day resulted in a much higher, much worse pain, every time. These past 2 months, because of my ankle injury, I was barely able to do any exercise, and my back is still\u2026 okay? How is this happening?\n\nI\u2019m stumped.\nThis doesn\u2019t feel right.\nWhat the hell is wrong with me?\n",

    "text": "I've been seeing my physiatrist/pain specialist since 2009. DR F left a big hospital clinic and I followed to her new practice. I always felt there was mutual respect between us. Last November a new girl started working at the clinic as the receptionist. We'll call her Vicky. My mother had fallen and broken her hip. I called to reschedule my appointment as Mum was in the hospital recovering from hip surgery and my dad who has dementia was not taking it well. I'd been trying to reach someone there for 2 days. When someone finally answered I got Vicky. As I explained what was happening, the hospital called on the other line so I asked Vicky of she could hold for a second while I make sure there was no emergency with my mother. My mother had been having serious cognitive decline since the surgery with delirium and aggression. I'd had to go to the hospital and help calm her down several times. Vicky snapped \"I've got work to do, you're gonna have to call us back.\". I was so stressed out, getting them on the phone is hell. Vicky's callous attitude was the straw that had me in tears. I was sobbing. Fast forward to the spring, I injured my shoulder and Dr F ordered an MRI. A week passed and I didn't get a call to schedule the MRI so I called to check on the referral. I had to leave a voice mail and heard nothing. I called once a week for 3 weeks and got no reply. Saw my Dr F again and asked if she could check on the MRI order, she said she sent it to her staff to resend. This went on for 3 months. Then the same thing happened with the surgical referral for 3 months I would leave a message once a week and document it. Vicky is nasty when nobody else is around. I've overheard her on the phone being rude to other patients. Every time I get Vicky on the phone she is caustic. I dont react, I am always polite even when I wish I could grab her through the phone. \nToday was weird and kind of hurtful. I'm the sole caregiver for my parents who both have dementia now. I've been having struggles with the respite/caregivers not showing up on my appointment days so I've had to take my parents with me for the last 3 appointments. Today I went to my appointment and the conversation with my Dr seemed different. As we were exiting the treatment area I saw Vicky look at Dr F and make a face like \"ew gross\". It is really bothering me. Dr F opened a Med Spa a few years ago and it is booming, she has changed a lot physically and in her demeanor. She has gotten very skinny having started GLP-1 injections(SHE WAS ALREADY HEALTHY), botox, and a host of other procedures. Tonight I went to look at reviews of Dr Fs pain clinic and I see several people who, like me, followed her from the big hospital clinic, been with her for 13+ years writing scathing reviews after being discharged without warning. They describe the rude receptionist and being discharged out of the blue. Vicky has done little passive aggressive things as well. For example my pharmacy is close on Saturday and Sunday and one month the Dr wrote my scripts for a day the pharmacy was closed. I called to request a release 1 day ahead on Frday. Instead of calling to ok the release of my scripts on the Friday Vicky told me the Dr said I had to transfer my prescriptions to another location of that pharmacy that was open on Saturday insisting I could do it over the phone. I couldn't, I had to drive to pick my prescriptions up 20 miles that day and go to another town to get them filled a 30 mile trip. The doctor had never said that. I feel very uncomfortable going to my appointments now. I am dreading getting a discharge letter when I have never been out of compliance, never failed a UA. Finding a new pain doctor is difficult. You are immediately treated with suspicion. I live with psoriatic arthritis mutilans with foot fractures and deformities, a failed L4-S1 fusion with disks failing above the fusion, spinal cord stenosis, compression and bone spurs in my neck with vertebrae sliding into the thecal space and bone spurs and 2 complete tears in my right shoulder rotator cuff. My pain level at worst is an 8, best is 4-5. \nI wonder if I should start looking for a new pain doctor now before I get shafted or just carry on amd hope things don't get worse. I guess I kind of wanted this documented. I don't know what Vicky's little ugly mou of distaste was about. I'd \nlike to be able to say fuck it, I'll take my business elsewhere but this is serious. Without my pain meds I can't walk any distance, can't sleep. I damn sure wouldn't be able to take care of my parents. I think I'd end up in the river with a cinderblock tied to my foot. ",

She might not ask why, but I would honestly tell her why if she asks. I\u2019m sorry to say it seems like it\u2019s going to happen anyway, so you might as well get some names from her before you are discharged and have to find your own.

    "text": "Does anybody else have weird hot & cold flashes?? Hormones have been tested and ruled out, and I really think it's related to my spinal cord damage or maybe (but I don't think so) my meds.\n\nI had rheumatic fever as a child, and my body temp has been almost 2 full degrees below normal since. It usually takes me 2 years to train new docs to realize and understand this, and thst if I come in with a 98 or 99, I am severely sick and need treatment.\n\nHowever......in the last 15 years it's gotten weirder. When I'm cold, Inam miserable and my temp has registered as low as 94.  When I'm hot, it shoots up.\n\nI also have cold chills and hot flashes out of nowhere. I get literally drenched in sweat, and the next minute I'm shivering and teeth chattering in my wet clothes. These come out of nowhere, with no warning.\n\nMy neorosurgeom thinks I'm nutty. He says he doesn't think it's my spinal cord. \n\nBtw, I am not paralyzed, but have lost some function in my arms and hands. My damaged vertebra were leaning on and pinching my spinal cord. I had 3 fused and a cage put in to protect my spinal cord in June. Neurosurgeon says it would've been destroyed - he used the word \"liquify\" - without the surgery. \n\nI take MS Contin 15 mg every 12 hours and  and 15mg oxy every 6 hours for my chronic pain. My pain is down my legs and in my arms. Pretty sure it isn't my meds. \n\nThanks!",

    "title": "Update to the HEB pharmacy changes I posted about last Friday. The Pharmacy Manager called me just now and this was our discussion and what he said.  Thought anyone who used HEB Pharmacy in Texas might want to know.",
    "text": "I sent several emails out to their corporate office as well as to the pharmacy manager at this specific store last Friday.  Surprisingly I received a phone call today just now from the pharmacy manager about the issue.  I explained a little more in detail what happened from last Friday.  He told me that yes, they made changes that are to going into effect Nov. 1st but that he was looking at my medications and my profile in their system and said that the pharmacist should have filled my medications, because I didn\u2019t fit the profile of what they are looking out for when it comes to refusing to fill,  He said there might be some confusion on the corporate mandated changes, that he is going to have a sit down with their pharmacists and go back over what the changes are, etc.  He said that there are concerns about drug abuse and people coming in trying to get large quantities of pain medication filled, and there are certain issues, or flags, if you will, that they are looking out for to weed out people who are abusing their medication.  He told me they have limited my medication to only 120 pills per month and he sees that is what my prescription was for and so it didn\u2019t come under their new guidelines for refusing to fill.  He also said he could see I have been on the meds a long time in their system.  I told him I am on long term opiate therapy and have been on this same medication for more than 10 years and was confused and a little alarmed that I was being told \u201cchronic pain patients take to many of their pills\u201d as a justification for refusing to fill.  I said that felt discriminatory if they had in fact decided to only fill for anyone else BUT chronic pain patients.  He said he understood, and this wasn\u2019t the case of them deciding to cut off chronic pain patients.  He did tell me to send my prescription back over to them and he would see that it got filled, but I told him my prescription was sent to CVS and they finally filled it today.  Again, he re-iterated that there is some confusion with this pharmacist, but today he is having a meeting with them all to go back over who they should and should not fill medications for based on their new policy and I did not fit that criterion for refusal.  I asked if I could reach out to him next month should I encounter this problem again at his pharmacy and he said yes, but he felt confident I shouldn\u2019t have a problem.  But he did say that they are going to have to call my doctor as the new policy involves speaking to my doctor about my treatment plan, my health issues, etc. as they want to have everything thoroughly documented in my file.  I said I understood and would let my doctor know when I see him next month.  I also said \u201cplease don\u2019t get after the pharmacist, as I really didn\u2019t want to get her into trouble, that it does sound like there is confusion and it is good he is going back over what their new corporate policy is.  Anyway, I did get my medication filled late this afternoon.  I will update this again if I encounter any further issues next month.  But I did tell him I would go ahead and tell my doctor to send my medication back to this pharmacy location and hopefully we won\u2019t have any more incidents. Ok done with the update and I hope all of you that get your meds filled at HEB Pharmacy have a good heads up on all of this.  Thank you to everyone for being so supportive and giving so many words of advice and suggestions.",

But youre going to go back to them next month? \n\nPaying attention to Reddits pharmacy sub they dont make much money on opioid scripts, but there are scripts they do make some money on. I would take everything I had and move pharmacies. Id also let family and friends know so they could do the same. Pain patients will continue to be treated like garbage for as long as we allow it.

    "text": "This year has been really rough. I'm so grateful to be able to pursue treatment right now and yet at the same time want to give up again. After having my previous doctor tell me that I was faking I had to find another doctor this year to help me figure out what's wrong. I've been dealing with chronic pain on and off for years which tends to effect my arms/shoulders the most. I've lost feeling in my arms many times. My new Dr thinks I'm dealing with carpal tunnel but something deep down tells me that's not it. Ive had multiple X-rays and MRIs but all have returned normal. I have an EMG right before Thanksgiving next month and honestly I'm dying. I hope it tells us something but I'm so unconvinced at this point. Having multiple blood test and imaging come back normal is wearing me down. I broke down in front a of nurse last week on my way out of the office. She asked me what's wrong and I said \"nothing, it's all normal again\". She hugged me and I left sobbing. I can't keep explaining to everyone that I'm in pain, that I'm tired... I finally bought a cane to help out on the days my knees don't want to work right and I'm trying not to be embarrassed and yet I still am. I don't want to keep taking pain medication for it to barely help. Its fucked up but I'd rather suffer at this point \n\nOn top of this I can't get accomodations at work since I don't have e a diagnosis, which I know HR can't legally ask for but even my doctor was like, I can't fill out this paperwork since we don't know whats wrong with you. Idk I think I'm getting the run around from both parties... I just... I can't keep doing this. I'm so so so incredibly tired. I just wish I could go back to when nothing was wrong or at least dormant. ",

I have seen lots of MRI reports, but I have never seen one that says \"IT\"S CLEAN\". A great deal of opinion can get wrapped up in the test results. Just the facts.\n\nGet used to the idea that these negative test results, if they are really negative, is a good thing. Sometimes with blood tests they have to do a couple over a period of time to catch what they may looking for. An EMG isnt a very comfortable test. If youre not sure what to expect, by all means ask, knowing what to expect can make the exam go much easier. \n\nYeah you could be getting a bit of the medical run around from this doc. I am sure they put in some sort of preliminary diagnosis and medical code to get paid by the insurance. Somebody is telling a fib to avoid filling out paperwork. I'll bet your insurance has a diagnosis code or the doc dont get paid. Very sad...",

In years past that was one of the \"red flags\" that was often associated with forged prescriptions. It's not so much an issue in this day and age. Schedule 2 and some schedule 3 meds must be sent to the pharmacy electronically. And pharmacies are suppose to ask for positive ID from anyone filling a script for a scheduled drug. Is this your mom's regular pharmacy? If so, there shouldn't be an issue, let alone claiming that distance between prescriber and fill location was the problem.\n\nYes, pharmacists can seem a bit intrusive and judgmental. But in recent years, more responsibility has fallen on pharmacists that had resulted in many losing their license. If a patient were to OD and die on prescription pain medications, the doctor who wrote those scripts can be held responsible. More recently, the pharmacist who filled those scripts can also be in hot water. Knowing that, their behavior is still irritating, but somewhat understandable.",

We already tried a class action where the circuit court in FL  said chronic pain is a symptom, as such we have no ADA protections. If we were a bunch of  Fibro patients, then you get ADA.

Each time I feel a stab it's so intense I feel like I'm going to pass out from the pain. The other night I had one of these attacks when my fianc\u00e9 and his father were out of the house and my two young children were in the bedroom sound asleep. I couldn't move to get to my phone and I couldn't even call out to Siri to call someone because I was just gasping for air just trying to breathe through the pain. \n\nAnother attack happened tonight but thankfully my fianc\u00e9 was standing right next to me when I went into it. I've NEVER felt anything like this before. He couldn't do anything but at least he was there to be able to call someone if it got to that point. \n\nI've gone to the ER twice already and the most they did was X-rays of my neck which showed neck straightening and they diagnosed me with a sprain or strain (literally didn't tell me which one I have just diagnosed it as both) they refused to do X-rays of my back and just wrote it off as a back sprain or strain. \n\nCurrently working with an attorney to get medical treatment that I truly desperately need since the lady's insurance is trying to not cover the second ER visit and doesn't sound like they want to cover anymore medical treatments. \n\nI thought I knew all there needed to be known about pain in the 10+ years I've been in it but this new pain is terrifying and I have no idea how long it'll last or even if it'll go away. It's debilitating. I can't even pick up my kids anymore. I can't grocery shop. I can't do anything anymore.

    "text": "Hey guys...\n\nMaybe this is commonplace, but I have spent the past several months seeing a pain management doctor, and after trying a bevy of therapeutic treatments (tens, exercise, pool decompression, yoga, meditation, cupping, acupuncture, massage, therapy), I have lost hope that they are going to be able to find something to treat my pain. To be clear, I have a confirmed spinal disease that is progressive and lifelong. It is a rare disease, but verified nonetheless with multiple doctors and neurologists. I have no history of addiction or abuse of any sort, so when I finally broke down and just asked if I could be put in a program to have opioids, they told me that the pain management clinic 'doesn't believe in using opioids, even for therapeutic purposes'. I offered to sign releases, do regular drug tests and pill counts, and they said this. \n\nWhat am I supposed to do? It's hella expensive even with my insurance to see this doctor and play their experimental games. I've tried lyrica and gabapentin at their requests, and they've made no difference as well. Some years ago, in the before times, I took Norco for a year and a half with no issues, and was able to function like a person. However, that doctor retired, and I have yet to find one who will listen since. \n\nI'm just at a loss, and it all feels hopeless. I don't know what else to do, and the pain is putting my job in jeopardy with how much I miss, even with an FMLA from my doc. ",

    "text": "A little over a year ago, my relationship with my then-boyfriend ended. He had been diagnosed with a condition that led to extreme pain about 7 months prior. He was overwhelmed with his chronic pain to the point where he once cried in front of me (something he was very embarrassed about and that he doesn't ever do). Between the actual physical pain, trying out experimental treatments to get better, work, and trying to be a good dad to his teenagers (one who was entering their senior year of high school), it was all too much to handle. As if that wasn't enough, there were other stressors in his life as well that made everything else even harder. He was depressed and basically just holding it together to fulfill his basic responsibilities. It came down to \"I have so little energy and the little energy I have, I have to give to my kids,\" which I understood. He expressed hope that we could reconcile in the future IF he could get better, but that he wasn't sure if he ever would.   \n\n\nFast forward to now. His pain has improved about 50% despite taking no medication, and we're slowly on the road to reconciling. However, a few months before the end of our relationship, he said something that hurt my feelings. It wasn't anything outright mean or angry; no personal attack or criticism of me...it wasn't even phrased in a mean way, but he said something that made me question my role in his life. It was in response to me vocalizing my frustration about his increasingly inconsistent schedule with me. I don't think he would ever have said it had he not been in such extreme pain and emotionally distressed, but I think about it every few months or so.   \n\n\nI have no reason to doubt his feelings for me...he was the perfect partner before the pain...did so much for me that I couldn't even begin to reciprocate...we were actually engaged (he had bought two rings but hadn't formally popped the question yet)... and he has chosen on his own to come back into my life as a partner. He also never actually left my life completely, although we rarely talked.  \n\n\nAll of this to say....I guess my question is: since I know chronic pain sufferers are more (understandably) prone to irritability and anger, **have any of you said something to your partner that you didn't mean or ended up regretting**? I'm thinking I might just let it go and accept that this is something he said when he was in the depths of pain, since I'm not sure he would even remember saying it.   \n",

Last night, I woke up completely disorientated, thought it was 6:45am, not pm, and was so enraged that I had finally been able to sleep for more than 3 hours for the first time in a week and a half that, when I was woken up by somebody playing 4 keys on the piano Ober and ober (which is what woke me up), I screamed WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU FUCKING DOING CAN YOU FUCKING STOP? Not realizing that it was minutes until my family Christmas party was about to start and that the person on the piano was a 9 year old child who I had just screamed at like an insane person. And that definitely isn't the first or the last time. You should hear me in the car. I hate having to be in a car because of everyone else on the road and because it physically pains me to be in a car for longer than 20 minutes at a time. So, what I'm trying to say here is that pain can absolutely make you irritable and cause you to say mean things to people. You can tell how much pain I'm in by looking through my reddit comments. Lmfao. \n\nThat said, it isn't okay to do so because nobody should have any excuse to say hurtful things to anyone and dealing with chronic pain and it's symptoms is something that everyone has to do and learn to cope with. If he's only ever said one hurtful thing to you due to his pain, then he has some really amazing self discipline because, man, I'm single for a reason. \n\nHowever, I would like to state that living with chronic pain makes people be a lot more honest and realistic about their life and the people in it. If you don't like what he said and made you question your position in his life, then you should ask him about it (calmly and without saying it hurt your feelings. Just say \"hey, so, when we were in the car, you said XYZ, can you please tell me what you meant by that\") because he may be being truthful with you and you need to accept your position or exit the relationship.",

It sounds like you would make an excellent life partner with your understanding and compassion. I\u2019ve been married 23 years. Met my husband when I was 19 and we got married when I was 22. We were always the athletic couple\u2026.our dates a lot of times would consist of playing tennis together or other sports! After I had our two kids, I started running marathons and got a black belt in TKD. He was playing baseball and we\u2019d work out all the time together. We both coached too (my husband baseball and football and me lacrosse and field hockey). So it was really hard when I started having health problems 6 years ago and especially now can maybe get a walk in and that\u2019s about it. So just the other day I yelled at him because after he walked 6 miles and then lifted weights for an hour, he came in and started complaining to me about his calf being sore. That just set me off and I basically said \u201cyou have no idea what real fucking pain is like and stop complaining when you can work out 2-3 hours and I can\u2019t even get off the fucking couch today!!\u201d I felt terrible the second I said it and he felt terrible and apologized for being \u201cinsensitive\u201d. Of course, he wasn\u2019t being insensitive, it was totally my fault! I apologized and started crying and told him honestly I just felt jealous but I\u2019m happy he is keeping healthy working out and I should never dismiss his pain. Point is, yes, I\u2019m sure almost all of us have done it. The real key is simple and that\u2019s communication.  And honesty.  I try not to complain but if I\u2019m having a really bad day, I will tell him honestly and he\u2019ll comfort me. And if I\u2019m having a good day, I\u2019ll tell him that too and sometimes he\u2019ll even change plans he had so we can go out and do something together. It takes some time to figure out what works best like any relationship but you can do it. If he hurts your feelings, tell him calmly cause likely he didn\u2019t mean to as you said but just because we\u2019re in pain doesn\u2019t mean we should lash out at our partner. Sure, sometimes it just comes out but it\u2019s important to give him a \u201cgut check\u201d. Sorry for the long answer but I wish you the very best moving forward!!",

    "title": "Targeting Nuclear Receptors for Chronic Inflammatory Pain: A Potential Alternative, any feedback in this regard?",
    "text": "\n\n\nIm focusing to have pain relief from an nerve injury, nerve root compression and disk bulging.. Constant pain, Following with more info in this regard, Im willing to order it today due to pain getting worst from stopping a prescription. \n\n\n\nSR9011 is a synthetic compound that belongs to the class of Rev-Erb agonists. It is a potent activator of Rev-Erb\u03b1 and Rev-Erb\u03b2, which are nuclear receptors that play a crucial role in regulating the circadian rhythm, metabolism, and inflammation. SR9011 has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential therapeutic applications in various fields, including medical, environmental, and industrial research.\n\n\n\nThe biological effects of SR9011 on cell function and signal transduction are diverse and complex. SR9011 has been shown to regulate the expression of various genes involved in metabolism, inflammation, and circadian rhythm. It has also been found to modulate the activity of various signaling pathways, such as the AMPK, AKT, and NF-\u03baB pathways.\nThe potential therapeutic and toxic effects of SR9011 depend on the dose, duration, and route of administration. SR9011 has been shown to have beneficial effects on glucose and lipid metabolism, inflammation, and circadian rhythm in various animal models.\n\nTargeting Nuclear Receptors for Chronic Inflammatory Pain: A Potential Alternative\nInteresting parts of the article\n\n\nPain is the unpleasant consequence of detrimental neuronal activity that can be triggered by chronic inflammation, noxious stimuli, and nerve damage. In the case of chronic inflammatory pain, the establishment and maintenance of pain states often depend on the chronic activation and immune response occurring at the site of the peripheral nerve injury. Many current analgesic drugs lack efficacy in long-term pain management. Targeting the nuclear receptor family of transcription factors may provide a novel avenue for the treatment of chronic inflammatory pain. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) ligands have demonstrated efficacy in several diabetic-related neuropathic pain models, while the REV-ERB receptors play a key role in the regulation of both P2X7 receptor expression and NLRP3 inflammasome expression and activation. As such, activating the REV-ERB receptor may provide an anti-inflammatory and analgesic option for chronic inflammatory pain sufferers.\n\n\nhttps://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsptsci.2c00063\n\n\nThe nuclear receptor REV-ERB\u03b1 modulates Th17 cell-mediated autoimmune disease\n\nREV-ERB\u03b1 and diseases\nREV-ERB\u03b1 has been implicated in regulation of a variety of diseases including inflammatory diseases, metabolic disorders and cancers (Table \u200b(Table2)2) 3,4. REV-ERB\u03b1 expression is often times altered (expression changed and rhythm disrupted) during disease development 24,25. Reciprocally, dysregulation of REV-ERB\u03b1 in humans and mice impacts the organism susceptibility to diseases 25-27. REV-ERB\u03b1 knockout elicits disturbance in genome-wide gene expression (Figure \u200b(Figure2A).2A). The differentially expressed genes are associated with pathways involved in various pathological processes and diseases (Figure \u200b(Figure2B).2B). There is accumulating experimental evidence supporting REV-ERB\u03b1 as a therapeutic target for diseases in the liver, lung, colon, pancreas, heart and bone (Figure \u200b(Figure33 & Table \u200bTable22).\n\n\nRole of REV-ERB\u03b1 in inflammatory diseases\nInflammatory diseases often times exhibit time-varying severity or symptoms. For instance, patients with rheumatoid arthritis show diurnal variations in symptoms, as manifested by great joint pain, stiffness and functional disability in the morning 28,29. Patients received aortic valve replacement in the afternoon show alleviated perioperative myocardial injury compared to individuals received aortic valve replacement at other times of the day 30. Asthma is more severe in the early hours of the morning 31. Diurnal rhythmicity in the severity of inflammatory diseases may be associated with circadian REV-ERB\u03b1, a negative regulator of rhythmic inflammatory factors. Mice display dramatic daily differences in their susceptibility to LPS/D-GalN-induced fulminant hepatitis, with a lowest survival time at ZT16 that corresponds to a low REV-ERB\u03b1 expression 27. Moreover, chronic colitis displays a diurnal rhythmicity in disease severity and its diurnal pattern is in an opposite phase to that of REV-ERB\u03b1 32. REV-ERB\u03b1 ablation abrogates the diurnal rhythms of REV-ERB\u03b1-related inflammatory factors 25,32.\n\nAccumulating evidence supports that targeting REV-ERB\u03b1 is a promising approach for management of inflammations. REV-ERB\u03b1 activation is shown to ameliorate ulcerative colitis 25,32,33, fulminant hepatitis 27, neuroinflammation 34,35, heart failure 36,37, myocardial infarction 38, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis 33,39, and pulmonary inflammation 29,40. Consistently, Rev-erb\u03b1-/- mice exhibit aggravated inflammations 25,27,33-40. Contrasting with a general anti-inflammatory role of REV-ERB\u03b1, Montaigne et al uncover a detrimental role of REV-ERB\u03b1 in ischaemia-reperfusion injury, an inflammation-related disease 30. The authors show that REV-ERB\u03b1 ablation or antagonism ameliorates ischaemia-reperfusion injury through promoting CDKN1a/p21 30. However, this study may not deny the anti-inflammatory effects of REV-ERB\u03b1 because ischaemia-reperfusion injury is also determined by many other factors such as calcium overload, oxidative/nitrosative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress in addition to inflammatory reactions 41.\n\nThe role of REV-ERB\u03b1 in regulation of innate immune responses has been well established. REV-ERB\u03b1 is involved in immune cell development, macrophage polarization, NF-\u03baB signaling, transcription of inflammation-related genes (e.g., cytokine genes, chemokine genes and receptor genes) and activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. REV-ERB\u03b1 impacts development of group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) and secretion of related cytokines (i.e., IL-17 and IL-22) by controlling mitochondria 42. Activation of REV-ERB\u03b1 impairs pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype and enhances anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype 43. REV-ERB\u03b1 suppresses NF-\u03baB signaling in human endometrial stroma cells and mouse macrophages/microglia cells, and down-regulates expressions of related genes, such as Nlrp3, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, IL-18, Tnf\u03b1 and Ccl2 25,34,35,44. In addition to an indirect regulation mechanism via NF-\u03baB signaling, REV-ERB\u03b1 directly regulates immune genes (e.g., Nlrp3, IL-1\u03b2, TLR4, IL-6, Ccl2, Mmp9 and Cx3cr1) 16,25,27,45-48 (Figure \u200b(Figure4A).4A). Furthermore, REV-ERB\u03b1 down-regulates Nlrp3 inflammasome activity to prevent ulcerative colitis, peritoneal inflammation, fulminant hepatitis and heart failure in mice 25,27,32,36.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWould aprecciate any feedback",

    "text": "Hi all, I\u2019ve had severe, stabbing eye pain and extreme photophobia since the end of October 2022. I\u2019ve had MRIs of my brain, orbits, and spine and everything looks normal. I\u2019ve had so many eye exams, visual field test, optic coherence tomography too. I\u2019ve been seen by 2 ophthalmologists, 2 Neuro-ophthalmologists, and 2 neurologists, none of whom can find a cause for my severe pain. \n\nI finally heard about the condition corneal neuralgia and it matches my symptoms exactly. It\u2019s listed on NORD as being a rare neuropathic pain conditions which can sometimes be brought on by eye trauma or chemotherapy, both of which I\u2019ve had - I had uveitis for the first time 1 month before the onset of the severe symptoms, and I had been on weekly methotrexate for 2 years prior. \n\nMy ophthalmologist hasn\u2019t responded yet and neither has my Neuro-ophthalmologist. In the meantime what I read is discouraging - treatments are experimental and there\u2019s a lot of talk about pain management rather than cure(s). I should also mention I already have diagnosed fibromyalgia, which apparently makes me more likely to develop this type of neuralgia. I\u2019m scared this pain is not something I can live with. It\u2019s so, so severe - it\u2019s been months since I\u2019ve been outside without a blindfold and I can\u2019t even turn on an overhead light.\n\nPlease, if you have this condition or know anyone who does, leave a comment on this post. I\u2019m desperate to know I\u2019m not alone. \n\nP.S.

I had left his practice a few years before it happened and he was always a great doctor. \nI've been blessed to have a child I am able to raise at home and since school has started found a great part time during school job at Amazon that will pay for college degrees and has amazing insurance. It's just repetitive bending after only four hours four times a week caused pain that cannabis OTC medicine and my chiropractic care couldn't control. \nThis led me to pain management and feeling like a lab rat with them wanting to try invasive procedures that may or may not work knowing what has worked in the past. Now that the experiment is finished they are telling me to go to an er with at least six hours wait to suffer. \nThe only pain felt during the injection was intense and spread from my neck all the way down to my calf. This pain has not subsidized and is nothing I've felt before. They say any pain above injection area isn't they're problem and could last two to seven days.

        "text": "Heres the reality of it, without any doctors BS confusing the issue. Its pretty normal to have it be a decent experience while the local lasts. Youre numb, so you only have to be careful where and how you walk, not being able to feel your lower body. But when that local wears off (usually around 6 hours) you're going to feel more pain than when you started. You were stabbed in the spine with a big needle. Some of might be subjective, going from numb to pain  can make it seem more intense too, but usually its because you have been stabbed with a needle.\n\nYou can expect this to last anywhere for 2-5 days. Thats the average amount the pain lasts. Some folks feel none, some folks its a little longer, but 2 -5 days should be pretty accurate.\n\nLets get in to what can go wrong in one of these injections, just please dont freak and think any of its going on until you have been through the nasty period. There is one exception to this, that is if they nick part of the covering of your spinal cord (called the dura mater) and cause a leak of spinal fluid. That can cause a massive headache, never had one, but its described as one of the worst. People who it happens to dont wonder if they have it. The fix is very simple, at least in writing. They take a little blood from your arm and inject it in to your back. The blood seals the leak. So its called a blood patch.\n\nThere are a few more subtlle thing that can happen that take a little longer to develop. Since the injection is right in to the physical blood brain barrier, if they dont keep thing totally sterile, any germs have a straight shot to the brain. Brain infections are really bad news, but even a fresh out if school doctor doing one of these should know to keep the caps on the syringes, wipe the medication vials with alcohol before filling them and so on. Any kind of infection is the result carelessness on the part of the doctor since it can be avoided.\n\nAnother thing that can happen is that they actually hit the nerve with the needle. Since that can damage the nerve, they try to avoid it, the idea of the injection is to get the medication dispersed in to the surrounding tissues and let them (include the nerve tissue) soak it up. The longer they soak up the anti inflammatory steroids the better. But actually hitting the nerve itself is something they try to avoid. When the do hit and damage a nerve it usually gets better over time, but it does take longer than the few days of usual injection recovery, more like a matter of months than of days.\n\nThe last thing that can happen is the one that gets the most press, discussion and strikes the most fear, but its also pretty rare, something called Adhesive Arachnoidiitis. That soinal cord covering I mentioned before, the dura mater has 3 different layers to it. The Aracnoid layer is the one thats responsible for keeping that spinal fluid from leaking. But if the penetrate it and let the drugs loose it that layer, it can cause the tissues to become sticky and develop in to scar tissue (adhesions). Its pretty rare for that to happen since they want to let the drugs go in the epidural spaces, but it does happen on occasion. I'd call that physician carelessness too since its not in the right place. Arachnoiditis can happen as something totally unrelated to any procedure, so its considered its own sort of condition. As counter as it might seem the best treatment for it seems to be more steroids (given orally). But its its own disease, theyre looking hard for a cure and have made some big steps in that direction, but as of now there is no cure all they can do is fill the patient with more medication (including pain meds when the doc isnt too timid about them).\n\nThose are the big 3 of things that can go bad from spinal injections. Its all pretty rare. They dont separate \"adverse events\" in to type (they really need to) but the odds of post injection problem are about 1 in 20,000. But you dont know what they include in that. A headache from somebody who get an injection for headaches can count as adverse event. And Im sure there's a fair number who dont report it thinking theyre just being overly sensitive and it will pass. There is no incentive for a physician to report their own screw up. But they do a lot of these injections, almost every mom gets one in child delivery. Thats a lot of spinal injections.\n\nSo give it a few days and see how youre feeling. The next day is always pretty bad, especially after a short period of no pain from the local. If youre not showing any improvement after the weekend, get in to see your doc. Hopefully you'll get some direct answers to some direct questions about what might be going on. But I have a feeling you'll be doing better,  maybe not completely recovered but on your way. Best of luck. I hope the injection is ultimately helpful. That can take a few weeks to know, depending on how inflamed the tissues were and if the problem was inflammation to begin with....",

    "title": "List of studies supporting efficacy of opioids for long term chronic pain and nuances to consider",
    "text": "We've all heard a doctor or news station say \"studies have shown that opioids are not effective for chronic pain.\"  This is simply false.\n\nI'm just hoping to help arm people with ammo to counter such statements.  First there is a difference between proving something is not effective and there not being definitive proof that something is effective. These are two very different things if you really think about them.\n\nThe list below was collected over 30 minutes of reviewing scientific abstracts searching Google scholar. They all conclude opioids efficacy in managing chronic pain over long time spans. They uses metrics like quality of life, pain scores and sleep.\n\nI can easily find articles that conclude \"it is not known whether or not opioids are effective for chronic pain.\"  In fact I saw some while searching for these.  What I did not see , which would be damning is a study that concludes \"opioids are not effective for CP.\"  Does that mean such a study doesn't exist? No...I probably could find one if I tried.\n\nPain is a subjective thing. Pain is not something as concrete as chemical reactivity or physical law.  Anything that involves the brain and pharmacology is very complex and subjective metrics such as pain are dependent upon the scientists experimental design.  A scientist (PhD or MD) or researcher MD (which your clinician doctor is not; and likely has a very limited exposure to understanding and reading scientific papers) can tailor a study design to reach the conclusion they want in such an area of study. They can throw out experiments that didn't get the answer they want.  This is done all the time in every area of science in order to \"score\" publications for the author or whoever is funding the science.\n\nSo when someone tells you opioids aren't effective you can say \"are tons of studies concluding that they are effective so that's not true.\"  If they start pulling out studies showing they are not effective well here are some that are.  So the correct conclusion is that according to some studies they are effective and some they aren't.  What is really the truth? There is not absolute truth to this answer and probably there never will be a definitive answer like how we get definitive answers for other more concrete  things like \"how do you calculate acceleration due to gravity.\"\n\nAnyhow most people including clinicians will be ill equipped to start debating specific scientific studies with you. So at that point they'll either say \"well this person is somewhat informed\" or \"this person is one high effort drug seeker.\" You can't control that. But don't just sit there  letting a doctor tell you it's settled science that opioids don't work because they are parroting some propaganda without having reviewed the resesesrch literature themselves. \n\nAlso please feel free to search terms in Google scholar and add to this working list. I know a lot of you are sitting in bed or recovering from surgeries and have a lot of spare time so it would be nice to really build out a list or talk about certain studies.\n\n\n\nManaging chronic nonmalignant pain: Overcoming obstacles to the use of opioids\u00a0Advances in Therapy\nvolume\n\u00a017,\u00a0\npages\n70\u201383 (2000)\n\nSafety And Efficacy Of The Unique Opioid Buprenorphine For The Treatment Of Chronic Pain\nJ Pain Res.\u00a02019; 12: 3299\u20133317.\n\n\nLong-term management of noncancer pain with transdermal therapeutic system-fentanyl\u00a0The Journal of Pain\nVolume 4, Issue 6, August 2003, Pages 298-306\n\nOpioids for managing chronic non-malignant pain: safe and effective prescribing.\nCanadian Family Physician September 2006, 52 (9) 1091-1096;\n\n\nTransdermal fentanyl as treatment for chronic low back pain\u00a0Journal of Pain and Symptom Management\nVolume 14, Issue 4, October 1997, Pages 218-224\n\n\nMorphine responsiveness, efficacy and tolerability in patients with chronic non-tumor associated pain \u2013 results of a double-blind placebo-controlled trial (MONTAS)\u00a0Pain\nVolume 97, Issue 3, June 2002, Pages 223-233\n\nFentanyl buccal tablet (FBT) for relief of breakthrough pain in opioid-treated patients with chronic low back pain: a randomized, placebo-controlled study\nCurrent Medical Research and Opinion\nVolume 23, 2007 -\u00a0Issue 1\n\nEvaluation of long-term efficacy and safety of transdermal fentanyl in the treatment of chronic noncancer pain\u00a0The Journal of Pain\u00a0Volume 2, Issue 4, August 2001, Pages 197-204\n\nTransdermal fentanyl\nDrugs\nvolume\n\u00a053,\u00a0\npages\n109\u2013138 (1997)\n\nSystematic review of efficacy and safety of buprenorphine versus fentanyl or morphine in patients with chronic moderate to severe pain\nRobert F.

    "text": "I was a pretty normal white collar office drone before my accident at work. Paying the bills and dreaming of bigger. Until one day, I opened a door at work and the winds of change literally slammed it shut and tore my wrist up.  I quit my job after the boss got snarky about the injury, and was shuffled out of employment and on onto Workcover. My career at the time in admin was literally ended by a metaphor, a door slamming shut. I found this mildly amusing*, and I hope you do too because that's the last comic relief part of my story.\n\nThe majority of my workers compensation case (two years) was spent seeking treatment for the symptoms of my condition, whilst constantly being called upon to  prove I was experiencing pain at all.\nI received a diagnosis of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome a few months after a surgeon noticed that my wrist injury had triggered unusual neuropathic symptoms of pain and skin discoloration. It spread rapidly into both upper limbs, and stayed. It intermittently spread into my lower limbs and neck/chest, but then settled on a few occasions.\n\nI had blood tests, several neurosurgeon physical examinations, an MRI on my wrist and multiple pain specialist appointments before I had my condition confirmed. I had many classic markers and the experts on \"my side\" of the workers compensation fence agreed that this was my new normal. I had some disagreements from the insurance company doctors who mostly believed that a central sensitization disorder was present but I didnt meet all workers comp diagnostic criteria. Still other insurance doctors said that I was lying entirely.\n\nMy CRPS was treated for several months without prejudice until things got expensive, and the insurance company changed tack. It was cheaper to prove that I didn't have CRPS as my wrist had healed. Private detectives cost less then specialists and experimental treatments, and thus they were contracted to stake out my home, local shops and doctors appointments to \"prove\" I wasn't experiencing pain. I added extreme anxiety and depression to my list of symptoms, and eventually sought private, inpatient treatment in Perth Clinic for six weeks in order to cope. \n\nMy pain syndrome was never once \"accepted\" by the insurance agency. The Budapest criteria used for the diagnosis of my condition is accepted on a worldwide basis across many medical fields, however worker's compensation law has omitted many of the clauses that make cases for pain relief straightforward. \n\nDuring my hospital stay a meeting at Workcover was called, questioning my condition. I was called upon to provide further proof of my suffering and to refute footage of me walking through a shopping centre without obvious pain (filmed conveniently after intense ketamine treatment temporarily improved my symptoms) or be forced to have my wages cut off for three months pending arbitration. \n\nI struggled to organise the necessary documents given my inpatient status and mental state but arranged for my doctor to provide medical reports. My lawyer requested an extension so that I might attend the meeting with appropriate documents and representation. This request was denied, thus resulting in the meeting going ahead without my medical report and my wages being suspended. It was at this time I decided to settle the claim due to the extreme and sudden financial hardship this action caused, and the major toll that had already been taken on my mental health. The settlement paperwork itself was signed from my hospital bed, while out of my mind on pain killers.  \n\nAs a result of constantly having my condition questioned during the compensation process, I suffered from a lack of confidence in my diagnosis, resulting in countless follow up medical tests and appointments to verify my condition, and extreme PTSD/anxiety about leaving the house for fear of surveillance. I spend my life living in fear, alternating between being resigned to a future with my condition and total dejection, spending endless hours googling my symptoms online, searching for alternative causes for my pain. I am a prisoner in my own home in Willetton and used to struggle to leave the house alone. I jumped at shadows. I looked for surveillance cameras in the bushes. I got my groceries delivered and rarely left to go anywhere but to doctors appointments. \n\nI wasn't the insured party here. That was my former employer. They're the customer. I wasn't a person. More like a broken car, that needed to be repaired. In the end, it was determined by the insuring party that my circumstances were cheaper to write off than to repair. I was bullied and coerced into accepting a settlement that was in the client's best interests and not my own. The legacy of my experience was pain, humiliation and what felt like a very real fear of being stalked when I leave the house. I'm very much worse off today mentally for their actions. Its taken years to shake that feeling of dread, and with a LOT of inpatient rehabilitation and therapy for my mental health, I'm starting to get there. \n\nAfter my pain specialist commenced a three monthly cycle of ketamine infusions, I began to see some dramatic improvements in my ability to cope with the high levels of pain. Again, when I was prescribed Memantine I saw great improvements. My in-hospital infusions became very much out of the question during the Covid 19 shutdown period, and I commenced daily ketamine lozenge therapy at a much lower dose which also helped a great deal with my pain and seemed to help alleviate some of my depressive symptoms too. Unfortunately, this alone was not enough to feed the pain monster within and thus I was gradually forced to begin taking opiates again. This almost broke my spirit entirely. I loathe opiates with a passion. It took a five week stint back at the Clinic, a full 20 day course of Transmagnetic Cranial Therapy and an additional two weeks of intensive Cognitive Behavioural Therapy before I felt I was strong enough to recommence my ketamine infusion schedule. \n\nI have a history of long admissions, and I freely admit that when I'm in psychiatric care as an inpatient, I become a new Moo. I am transformed by hope and I start to get better each time, only to fall down again when i go home. I look around each ward every time and see some patients who are more or less permanent residents and tremble with dread. I know mental health wards are only a bubble. I want to be able to live life as well as I can, and ideally never be an inpatient again unless it is for very extreme circumstances. TMS and the immediate follow-up of CBT have definitely helped improve my depressive symptoms, more than anything else I have ever tried. \n\nI have long accepted that my pain levels will never be where I want them to be, and that there are some days where I might as well not bother taking any medications at all for how much the good the pills seem to do for me. If anything, the semi-regular arrival of new hotspots that appear in other parts of my body predict a future filled with more pain than I can currently comprehend. What I have learned is to live with the pain, to accept that we must co-exist, to push through when I can, and to rest when I cannot. \n\nThe only part of my life that I can improve is my attitude to how I process my pain, and to continually focus on non-pharmaceutical ways to make living with CRPS more bearable. I embrace medications that help to enhance neuroplasticity in the brain, such as Memantine and low dose Ketamine. I take many supplements to decrease inflammation. I live and breathe mindfulness techniques. I force myself to commit to at least an hour of physical exercise per day, and in my spare time, I lobby government officials with emails and meetings, trying to convince them that older pain relief options like Hyberbaric Oxygen Therapy are worth studying again. I even offer myself as a clinical study case in order to collect valuable data for the pain specialists and professors in this country that share similar views. Its a good little hobby that keeps my mind and spirit active, and -  who knows? - maybe one day I'll even get somewhere. \n\nUntil then, I'll be here, fighting the good fight against myself, trying to avoid getting too \"paingry\" at those I love, and just doing my best to seek joy as opposed to pain in all areas of my life. \n\nWhat was your triggering event?\n\nLove, Moo xoxo\n\nPS. * Proof reading comment: I no longer find this metaphor quite as funny, but I'm leaving it in. Its my only joke and I'm committed to it now. \ud83d\ude02",

        "text": "Sorry about the editing, am on my phone.\n\nMy story is a fucked one. It started 7 years ago when I asked to have my tubes tied. Cool, I'm 30, so my doctor agreed. I had to see a gyno / surgeon and convince them I really wanted it. An hour n a half later she agreed. I'll be having it done in March 2013. Awesome. Was told to get off my birth control in Dec 2012. Not a problem. \n\nMarch comes. I'm still waiting to hear about a date. I call them. I've been out on a wait list. Okay, no problem. So when? You're on a wait list. We'll call you. Fuck. I call again in Aug of 2013. Still on a wait list. Call again in Jan of 2014. Wait list. Whatever. I guess they'll call me.\nFast forward to Oct of 2015. Find out I'm pregnant. Not sure how, I've been hella careful. In freaking out. This is the last thing I wanted. Go to my doctor and let her know. She freaks out cause she thought I got my tubes tied. I inform her that I'm on a wait list. She's mad. She calls the gyno and flips out on her.\n\nI see the gyno. Sure thing, I'm 12 weeks pregnant. I'm asked several times if I wanna keep it. No. In asked what the father thinks. I don't fucking care. My body. My choice. Get it out of me. After 3 days of calls and ultrasounds they finally agree to do the abortion and tubal ligation together.\n\nNov 15th 2015 I go in to get them done. It goes well, or so it seems. I'm sent home right afterwards. With no pain meds, I might add. Surprise surprise, the next morning I'm in so much pain I can't move. Ambulance called. Off to the ER. They pump me full of pain meds and send me home with more.\n\nNext two weeks go by uneventful. But the pain isn't getting better. It's actually getting worse. I see my doctor but she tells me to go away. I don't need more pain meds, Tylenol and advil is fine.\nSo back to the ER. They do a CT scan and find an ovarian cyst. Nothing they can do so they send me home with more pain meds and tell me to come back in a week if the pain hasn't gone away. Well it didn't go away. So another ER trip. Another CT scan and an ultrasound. They can't find a cyst. Must have burst. So I shouldn't be in pain. But I'm still in pain. Am told I need to see my doctor and the surgeon who did the procedure.\nI see the surgeon. He sees me and informs me that it must be my bowels. It's clearly not the procedure he did. I see my doc and she tells me I'm fine. Great guess I'm finding a new doctor.\nWent to the ER once a week till I found a doctor. This doc not only gives me pain meds but signs me up to a pain clinic. In the mean time she also gets me in to see another gyno. This gyno wants to do another laparoscopic surgery to see what's wrong.\n\nSurgery goes well. He says that he saw nothing wrong except some endometriosis. He cauterized it, so it shouldn't be a problem. Two weeks after the surgery the pain is still there. Lovely. This is also the point where my doctor cuts me off of my pain meds. She decided that the pain meds were why I was in pain. And I just needed to go to therapy, cause it was all in my head. Time for a new doctor. I didn't get a new doc until I was in the pain clinic over a month later. In order to get pain meds I went to the ER every other day. That was a shitty month.\n\nOkay so it's Nov 2018. I'm finally in the pain clinic and I have yet another doctor. One who agreed to do whatever the pain clinic asked. Well the pain clinic wants me to try Butrans patch. What a surprise, my new doc isn't cool with that. I return to the pain clinic and let then know. They're unhappy, so they sign me up to the clinic that's right beside them.\nThis is when things start getting better. This clinic not only listens to me, they want to help. They get me a new gyno and have me try every the pain clinic wants to try.\n\nMarch if 2019 I see the new gyno. She wants to see for herself and I get another ultrasound. She's having problems finding my right ovary and thinks it's twisted and that's why I'm having the pain. She also puts me in a birth control specifically for Endo. It was a lifesaver. No more periods!\nSept 30th 2019 I go in for my third surgery. Turns out my right ovary was twisted. So she removed it and my tubes. She also excised (think wart removal) my Endo. As apparently that's more effective than cauterization.\nAfter surgery they can't control my pain and a pain specialist is sent in. She asks if I've tried Suboxone, which is like Butrans but stronger. I haven't but am willing to try anything. Two weeks after surgery the pain is still there. I see the gyno again and she tells me that she suspects my pain is a combination of nerve and muscle pain. The best they can do is give me pain meds, as I'll likely have this pain for life.\n\nI'm okay with that. I'm happy to just have an answer. My doctors get me started on the Suboxone and things have been a lot better since then. I can now be more than a couch potato.",

It would come and go and I could never figure out why.  Cut to 12 years later and I am diagnosed with atypical Trigeminal Neuralgia.  It's nickname is \"The Suicide Disease\" because it's so painful that some people would rather die than live with it and there is no known cure.  So in spite of this bizarre painful condition  I managed to continue and get on with my life.\n\nThen in 2017 I was coming home from work, crossing the street with the \"walk\" sign plainly visible and this moron hits me with her car.   She crashed right into both my legs.  As I was dragging myself to the curb with my arms (since I could no longer stand) she rolls down her passenger side window and asks \"Are you ok?\"   Thank God people stopped to help me or she would have driven off and left me there in the road, she made it very clear she didn't want to deal with the aftermath of her mistake.   So now I've got permanent damage to my left leg and have to wear a brace.  I've got pain every day and there's a lot of things I just can't do anymore.    I lost the job I had when this happened because of Covid and I'm really scared I won't be able to find a new one because I am somewhat limited thanks to the accident.",

        "text": "Pregnancy really does a number on your body. I had a lot of pelvic pain in both my pregnancies from the loosening up of ligaments that led to SI joint instability. I went to therapy for several months which helped but when I aggravate it I feel like my whole pelvis is out of whack and I feel the misaligned joint articulate incorrectly. Makes me feel like a creaky 80 year old. \n\nAfter my second pregnancy ended (three years ago) I would have these weird two or three day episodes every several weeks of deep painful aching in my abdominal area. I figured it was my IBS but it just didn\u2019t feel like my typical IBS symptoms. About a year ago the episodes became more frequent and more intense; only thing I could do was lie flat on my back for a day or two until it subsided. This February the pain got worse and I haven\u2019t had a pain free day. My whole upper abdomen has the same deep ache and I have two areas of focal point pain. I\u2019ve has bloodwork, ultrasounds, endoscopy, and a CT scan. All unremarkable, no GI issues other than my IBS. A lot of my tests and doctor appointments have been slow because of COVID-19 but just waiting on my insurance to provide authorization for an MRI to rule out micro herniations. My pain management doctor is pretty sure based on the two focal points of pain that I have anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome (ACNES) caused by my abdominal muscles expanding and contracting due to pregnancy. He\u2019s suggesting trigger point injections into my abdominal pain areas, and I really hope this works. It\u2019s hard to take care of two kids stuck at home since March, homeschool them and provide them with endless activities to fight the cabin fever while constantly in a state of discomfort that lasts from waking up to fall asleep every day.

This is going to be a longer post so buckle in.\n\nI just got a new job 2 weeks ago, prior to that I'd been unemployed for 9 months due to chronic pain. I'd taken the time off for injections and experimental treatment for my pain and I've been a little bit better. I'm working at a long term care pharmacy and my boss has been nothing but rude to me. Normally this wouldn't bother me, I've dealt with asshole bosses before and I know that being an employee with chronic pain puts a large target on your back to people like them. The problem is that she is also my trainer and I couldn't just avoid her. I'm a pharmacy technician, a very experienced one too, however I have never used this pharmacy program before. So if  I have questions or I dont understand something she ridicules me and belittles me. I'm a very passive person and I have a very hard time standing up for myself so I just take it. This place is so unorganized that in 2 weeks I haven't had orientation, my desk hasn't been set up and I now have to do a third week of \"training\" with my bitch boss because she didnt do anything that she was supposed to do. I'm sitting at very tall desk that has basically a barstool to sit on and I'm 5'0 foot tall so my legs are dangling with no support. On top of my normal chronic pain now my ankles and calves have swelled up so bad it hurts because of the chair they placed me in.  I filled out disability paper work before my first day and they have completely ignored my reasonable accommodation requests. I put in so much of little to spare energy to even be there and decently put together enough so I dont look gross only to be treated like an idiot and the laughing stock of everyone. I'm so tired of trying and then being smacked in the face. I'm calling HR in the morning to put in a formal complaint against my boss but I feel that it will only make things worse. Please if anyone has dealt with something similar I'd really appreciate advice on how to handle this.\n\nEdit: I was very upset while writing this so I had some typos sorry",

    "text": "I suffered from moderate (occasionally severe) mid-back pain for years.  I reported such to various physicians, but they all assumed that I was lying because mid-back pain does not exist.  Then one day my pain suddenly became very severe.  It took another 2 years (and many pulled strings) to finally see a doctor who believed me, and he arranged for the appropriate scans.\n\nThese scans revealed that I have no Inferior Vena Cava (the IVC is the largest vein in the human body).  Doctors were quite excited to discover this, as I am the first known human to not have an IVC.  In fact, the doctor who found my aberration lamented that he now had to revise his medical textbook on the circulatory system because it incorrectly stated that humans cannot live without an IVC.\n\nThe good news about my condition is as follows: a) I am not dead, paralyzed, blind or experiencing hourly strokes as per my medical prognosis; b) doctors no longer accuse me of malingering because they spend most of their mental energies trying to work out how TF I am still alive; and c) since no doctor will touch me, my private income disability insurer does not dare interfere with or question my non-existent medical treatment.\n\nThe bad news is: a) I experience a constant intoxicating melange of debilitating pain and a horrible sensation of pressure from my undersize veins taking up the blood flow for my missing IVC; b) I was forced to give up my chosen career (that required 7 years of education) after working at it for only a few years; c) there is no medical knowledge about my condition, so I had to learn about managing it through self-experimentation; and d) opiates.\n\nSo, please remember my situation if you suffer from pain that has no known cause.  I was called a liar (in one way or another) by so, so many doctors who were simply too arrogant and/or lazy to admit that my condition was beyond their knowledge.  The fact that no medical cause has been found for your pain has no relevance upon the fact it still exists.  I believe you.\n\nEdit: I keep getting responses that link to articles about other people who have missing IVCs.  While I appreciate your efforts, all I can say in response is that my diagnosing doctor (who is a respected venous malformation specialist and is associated with the University of Toronto) kept saying that he had never witnessed a human circulatory system with such a complete absence of the IVC.  There was no further interest in my case because there is no known treatment.  Also, this conversation occurred way back in 2005 or 2006, so a lot may have changed since then. \n\nEdit 2: Frankly, I don\u2019t believe that my condition is as rare as the doctors said, so I am saying that it is the \u2018world\u2019s rarest\u2019 deformity with some tongue-in-cheek. After all, it took me nearly 2 decades to procure my mid-back scan.  I recently got my lower back scanned instead of my mid-back yet again because the radiologist(?) did not believe my neurologist\u2019s instructions.  How many others of us are needlessly suffering because of ignorance and arrogance?\n\nEdit 3: some doctors still tell me that my missing IVC cannot possibly cause me pain, as it has never been proven to do so.  I asked them all if this is because they have never studied a patient with IVC, and they all responded \u2018yes.\u2019  Flawless scientific reasoning!",

Publishing something like that would secure them tenure and fame for the rest of their career!\n\n...and possibly get you the opioids you need. All (\"all\") you have to do is find the right researcher who is looking for a topic to expound on. Obviously, you're in horrible pain (I can't imagine how terribly a missing artery would hurt -- much like closing I-5 out of LA and forcing all traffic onto local streets). Having researchers backing up your pain statements should keep the DEA away from the doctor willing to prescribe relief.\n\nI really feel for you. This has to be hell on earth! Ask your doctor to make a few recommendations about the right people to contact so you can begin your search. And keep your medical records handy.\n\nI don't know for sure this will work, but it might be an approach worth pursuing. Some painful conditions simply will not respond to anything but opioids; yours sounds like one of them. Best of luck to you; I think you could use some good luck right about now.",

    "title": "Ketamine is a really interesting compound to chronic pain patients which has tried any kind of meds and always back to old ways of pain relief",
    "text": "Hi, I want to tell my recent history linked to the title of this post: I tried a kind of experimental treatment with my neurologist, which consist in first a IV injection of a protect gastric like omeprazol, or a bottle of serum with pantoprazol, and after this a serum bottle with a mix of some meds: a medium dose of lidocaine which is an anesthesia without narcotic properties, a low-medium dose of ketamine, a low dose of midazolam which is a benzo of ultra-short action to help with some side effects of ketamine and an antiemetic. This treatment are 2 or 3 sessions according the effectivity and the needs of each person (I always do cycles of 3 sessions), and each of them lenght one hour or one and half hour, the time the bottle of serum takes to reach to your blood by IV and run out. There are some weeks of separation between 2nd and 3rd session, less time than of the 1st to te 2nd which is only a week or 10 days. \n\nWell, the effects of this treatment are AMAZING: I have A LOT of less pain in comparation before the treatment. I forget take pills or kratom because the pain is barely unexistent. Yeah still hurts a little bit, but SO MUCH bearable than before the treatment without ANY doubts. Remarkable effects, isn't a placebo or bullshit, and my mother can see the change without the constant high peaks of pain (crisis) which I had and I need in that situations go to urgencies for a IM shoot of diazepam+one or two AINES. \n\nAnd when I said I tried EVERYTHING about meds, is everything: AINES, muscle relaxant, antidepressants, gabapentin or pregabalin, benzos, medium opiates like tramadol and codeine and strong opiates for 4 years daily under medical prescription: I tried tapentadol, hydromorphone, morphine, fentanyl, oxycodone, etc. Today I'm in a methadone program and now I'm on 80mg, after lower my dose 2 days ago from 85mg and since November from 90mg. After that treatment, since the second session 11 days ago (is my second cicle in less than 8 months) almost always I only need my meds due rebound effect of the diazepam after 8 years on it, or due anxiety and I take that or another benzo. Diazepam, baclofen and kratom helps a little bit, and pregabalin still helps I think so, but isn't enough just the meds, for that this treatment I talking about. I writting about it to so many people in my same condition or similar can speak about it to their doctors or in their pain unit if their doctors has empathy and wants to help to the illness people really, no just for the money. Really the ketamine has incredible properties in the brain of patients with chronic pain, hope in a near future there would be research about ketamine and chronic pain and new kinds of treatments less addictive and without the hell of opiates after years on them.\nNow my last date of this cycle would be at the end of this month, and I can see how it goes the effects on a long term without another session soon, which is great to test this treatment for second time.\n\nThe effects of the first cycle when this was finished, lasted one month more or less before my pain became the same as always. I hope this time would be different after 6 sessions in 6-7 months, with the most possible lenght of the effects, at least till the call of the neurologist to the valoration of the prescription of Sativex to my extreme rigidity which is the cause of my pain 7 of 10 times for put an example. \n\n\nI have ketamine isomer S (esketamine) the most therapeutical ketamine of both isomers, but isn't the same at all snort some lines or take a medium dose orally, than IV route mixed with lidocaine, midazolam, omeprazol and an antiemetic, all of this like I said in a serum bottle with a IV route.\n\nSomebody try or tried ketamine or esketamine snorted or oral with therapeutical purposes (chronic pain in this case) with good results? \n\nAnd also I write about it for emotional relief, I love this room and their community, we're a mass of strongs warriors of any kind, gender and age \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaa One love people!!",

    "text": "So I've always had severe headaches, migraines, neck pain, and with my RA & connective tissue disorders I've had some pretty bad damage on my vertebrae. My entire body is always hurting but my biggest problem areas (In Order) are absolutely my head, neck, back, and hips. \n\nA symptom I've had for a very long time bow is this cold sensation on my scalp. Its never in the same spot, it feels like ice water being poured onto my scalp in one spot and trailing down. Before recently it's been a short term thing, I'm talking about an hour tops from the time it manifests. There's nothing I can pin down as a cause or an irritant and my doctor hasn't been too concerned about it considering it doesn't last long and happens periodically but not every day. Lately, however, we've been having more issues with my neck and my pain specialist has been trying to figure out how to help but each procedure has been a failure and the one he desperately wants to try is still considered experimental considering it involves sourcing my own stem cells as part of the treatment. Now, my doctor had made.the comment that the damage is definitely worse and has expressed concern and I tell you all of this to get to the issue I'm worried about.\n    Lately, I'd say within the past 3 weeks, the cold sensation has been a daily occurrence, it's gotten to where it shows up I'm an area about the size of a playing card but still not in a specific area but grows to about the size of a grapefruit and trails down into my neck wherever it is. Ive had it go from lasting an hour at most to lasting multiple days. When it happens I am typically having a pain spike as well this sensation and while my typical.daily pain ranges from a 6-8 these spikes bring me to an absolute10. I'm have a lot more severe days lately and my medications aren't always helping with the pain. \n\nHas anyone else had a similar experience? Was there something you were able to do for it that got you through? My doctor isn't sure what it is or what is causing it but we suspect my spinal issues considering they're the culprit for a good amount of my neck and head pain. However we're speculating and that isn't going to help me here. The reality is that it's getting worse and I'm having trouble making it through the days this is happening. My pain doc wants me to find a spinal specialist to see if they can help me and if nothing else itll be good to have a spinal doc keep an eye on the damage, bulging disks, fluid build up and inflammation just in case.",

Here are just a few examples\u2026\n\n-When I first worked in hospitals, everyone smoked\u2014patients and staff. The nurses\u2019 station was under a continuous cloud of cigarette smoke, with overflowing ashtrays everywhere. Doctors would do rounds with a cigarette hanging out of their mouth.\n\n-In order to rid newborns of those dirty vaginal secretions/s, we gave them their first bath in Phisohex soap. One day in the mid 70s, we were told \u201cdon\u2019t ever use it again\u201d (neurotoxic, I think). Also, I once cared for a woman in preterm labor on an alcohol drip.\n\n-Also in the 70s, we sometimes gave actual placebos for breakthrough pain. Typically for the young men with ortho trauma who spent weeks in the hospital on narcotics. Docs would order: *Normal Saline, 1 cc IM, PRN breakthrough pain*.\n\n-The opioid epidemic began in the early 70s with Demerol, which we gave to everyone in mod-severe pain. We were alarmed when they came back to the ED repeatedly asking for \u201cthree hundred milligrams of Demerol\u201d. But then we got OxyContin\u2026Also, so many non narcotic/NSAID drugs have come and gone, with all the crappy merch that came with every new drug. We had a Vioxx wall clock in our dirty utility room for many years, long after the drug had killed patients and been recalled.\n\n-For many years, just about every COPD exacerbation in the ED was put on an aminophylline drip (with all that smoking there was so. much. COPD.) Sometime in the mid 90s, I went on vacation for a few weeks, when I came back IV aminophylline was gone\u2014one of our most common drugs. It wasn\u2019t long before Pharma was advertising (I\u2019m not lying)\u2014*aminophylline thigh cream*\u2014to get rid of cellulite! We joked that they must have found themselves with warehouses full of aminophylline and some marketing genius said \u201cLet\u2019s make it into a cream and have people rub it on their cellulite. We can run a few studies!\u201d LOL!\n\nThe biggest practice change in my career was wearing gloves. With the exception of procedures requiring sterile technique, we did everything\u2014even wiped butts, without gloves. In the early days of AIDS we were reprimanded by our supervisors for wearing gloves while giving patient care to our AIDS patients. It was a difficult culture change for everyone.",

This is primarily due to the fact that most clinical trials have long life-cycles, and gaining experience requires work during the start up, implementation, subject recruitment, subject follow-up, and trial closure phases of a trial.\n\n* Some small Sponsors may be willing to work with you as a Principal Investigator without much prior experience.

Assuming that a starting career in clinical research as a PI\n\nAs Bigthama said, working towards PI is usually a path that people start in medical school and continue through residency (and fellowship, if applicable). If you're on this path, you should have already checked off some boxes by the time you are out of training:\n\n* You went to a residency (or fellowship) program that was heavily research oriented, published a few first author papers, and made some connections within your specialty's academic community\n* You prepared K grant applications before you completed residency (or fellowship). Hopefully you already have a grant in hand.\n* Your first job is an academic job with protected research time. Preferably something in the realm of 80% research time\n\nIf you haven't checked these boxes, you can't easily segue into being a PI. You would have to go back to training and complete a fellowship with a heavy research focus.\n\n> Assuming that a starting career in clinical research as a PI pays the same\n\nIt doesn't. This is the first thing to be aware of. There is less money in research. Maybe a lot less, depending on how well your clinical specialty is reimbursed.\n\n> If you switch to a research job and never did any true clinical practice are you basically locking yourself out of the clinical aspect\n\nNo, you are not locking yourself out. Generally it's much, much easier to move from research to clinical practice than it is to move in the opposite direction.\n\nThere are some caveats: If you completed a research heavy residency/fellowship, that usually involves sacrificing clinical time to fit in more research time, and for procedural specialties that can mean that your case numbers drop. This won't lock you out of clinical practice by any means, but it might make you less versatile as a proceduralist.\n\n> what\u2019s the key difference in lifestyle\n\nIt's a matter of perspective, and it really depends on your specialty and your personality. Research comes with the headache of a perpetual funding rat race and a constant grey cloud of uncertainty (what happens if you don't get the next grant). That's really stressful. On the other hand, it's a very different stress than loads of call and showing up at the hospital to handle 3 AM emergencies. If your specialty is heavy on that sort of thing, reducing your clinical hours and call to add research/admin time might be a lifestyle friendly move.",

    "title": "Wound care physicians - is anyone using negative electric charge to promote wound healing?",
    "text": "TL;DR version - does negative electric charge at wound site actually aid healing? If so, are wound care clinics actually using this method?\n\nI was recently reading a book of short stories and essays about various things, mostly sort of fringe science/paranormal stuff that would typically be considered \"mumbo jumbo\" (the book was recommended to me by a friend, i wouldn't have picked it out to read on my own, but i find myself to be entertained and intrigued by it). But then i read this paragraph about a scientist in the 1970s who successfully got amputated animal limbs to grow back with use of a negative electric current. The author doesn't cite any sources for all the grandiose claims so at first i was like \"no way, this is too big a claim\", i.e. \"proof or it didn't happen!\"\n\nSo then my curiosity was piqued. I did a quick google search for studies about negative electric currents and limb regrowth and wound healing. And darn it if this hasn't actually been shown to be true in randomized trials. Of course, the author sensationalized for dramatic effect, but it seems that wounds tend to have a negative charge about them when healing, and if you apply a negative charge from outside it seems to make wounds heal faster. No studies have yet shown a negative charge to help a mammal regrow a lost limb, but there have been studies showing that mice with amputated limbs could be induced to \"sort of start\" to regrow a lost limb, i.e. some additional bone and other tissue growth at a nub but without actual limb regrowth.\n\nWhat i'm really surprised about is that this seems to be well established scientific knowledge, that we have known about since the 1970s or earlier. But i don't remember hearing anything about it in medical school, and of all the patients i've referred to Wound Care, none of them ever had batteries attached to their chronic wounds as far as i know. So why not? Is it that it doesn't really work as well as the studies suggest, or that people aren't aware of the effects, or that there's some severe side effect or something?\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3762619/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3762619/)\n\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-20153-3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-20153-3)\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8236302/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8236302/)\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4683620/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4683620/) \\- this one is about rat limb regeneration",

CME credit will be given for attending the lecture. I am confident in my knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of these side effects. However, I am not a physician, so while I can talk about what has happened in clinical trials when when these side effects occurred (what course of action the physicians took), my knowledge when it comes to tests and drugs is somewhat limited. I know the big ones that would apply, but that's about it.\n\nI want my lecture to be helpful! I also have to turn my slides in ahead of time and have them approved by the medical school this session is sponsored by, so obviously want to make sure I do them correctly the first time. But I've been given no guidance and have no idea what CME lectures are normally like.  \nI'm open to any and all suggestions you have for how to make this lecture helpful to you. My plan right now is to cover the different types of side effects that fall into this class that can occur, what the underlying mechanism is, how they may manifest in the clinic, and ways that other physicians have responded. Sort of \"case study\" style. Part of this is going to involve a bit of a dive into molecular mechanisms of immune responses, which I know can make some people's eyes roll back in their head. Does this sound reasonable? Do you have any suggestions?\n\nThanks!",

The articles and lectures (pdf slides posted on the internet) suggest that the mFAR generally declines 1-2 points per year in FA, and the info I've seen suggests a 'placebo adjusted' improvement of slightly over 2 points at about 1 year of use (on a scale of 0-100). And many subgroups of treated patients had error margins in the improvement data that crossed \"0\" ie were not statistically significant - for example patients over 18y old, females, and non-ambulatory patients did not have 'statistically significant' improvement. \n\nI'm just curious!",

    "text": "I hate going to court. Every once in a while we will get a notice from a patient's lawyer that we will receive a subpoena for a pending court case. We then send a letter stating our hourly fees for depositions, court appearance etc. These are patients that we have seen in our outpatient clinic - for example after a car accident for a complaint of hearing loss or dizziness. So we are acting in the role of FACT witness, not as an EXPERT witness as we have (1) a relationship with the patient and (2) we are not asked to review any other medical records. The lawyer will always pay what we demand. But why? They can just issue a subpoena and I have to show up in court and testify anyway. Why pay good money for that? I have had our secretary communicate a few times that I would not have anything positive to add if they follow through with a subpoena because they never got any of the studies I ordered or did followup (noncompliant) - that will sometimes get them to drop the summons. Just wondering what other's experiences are? Because I wonder if the paralegals are confusing the role of EXPERT WITNESS vs FACT WITNESS. My game plan as a FACT witness is to just read the chart, say \"maybe\" or \"I don't remember\" or \"could be\" a lot since it is not me on trial and I don't want to be there.",

While psilocybin separated from placebo for a response, it did not do so for remission. For comparison, pretty much every standard oral anti-depressant separates from placebo when looking at remission (https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(17)32802-7/fulltext#sec1). It's apples to oranges as far as study design, but a single dose of psilocybin seems to not meet the important threshold in actually preventing relapse (i.e. remission). Also important to note this study is not looking at the far more common psychedelic-assisted therapy. \n\nAlso, it's really important for people not familiar with this to actually look at the exclusion criteria for psychedelics in these studies. In people with seemingly no significant risk factors these substances seem fairly benign, but the studies exclude a lot of people to get to that population.",

    "title": "The Chen 2023 Paper Raises Serious Concerns About Pediatric Gender Medicine Outcomes",
    "text": "When I started my Child and Adolescent Psychiatry training in the 2010s, the diagnosis and treatment of gender dysphoria were rapidly becoming controversial in the field. Doctors and nurses who had spent decades on inpatient adolescent units, usually seeing one gender dysphoric child every 4-5 years, now saw multiple transgender-identifying kids in every inpatient cohort. It was a rare patient list that did not include at least one teenager with pronouns not matching their sex.\r  \n \r  \nViewpoints about this differed, with every student, resident, fellow, and attending having their own perspective. All of us wanted what was best for patients, and these discussions were always productive and collegial. While I am not naive about how heated this topic can be online, I have only ever had good experiences discussing it with my colleagues. Some of my attendings thought that this was merely a social fad, similar to Multiple Personality Disorder or other trendy diagnoses, like the rise in Tourette's and other tic disorders seen during the early pandemic and widely attributed to social media. Others, including myself early on, thought we were merely seeing psychological education doing what it is supposed to do: patients who would, in earlier decades, not realize they were transgender until middle age were now gaining better psychological insight during their teen years. This was due to a combination of increased tolerance and awareness of transgender people and was a positive good that shouldn't necessarily raise any red flags or undue skepticism.\r  \n \r  \nDuring my outpatient fellowship year, I began to suspect a combination of both theories could be true, similar to ADHD or autism, where increasing rates of diagnosis likely reflected some combination of better cultural awareness (good) and confirmation bias leading to dubious diagnoses (bad). Confirmation bias is always a problem in psychiatric diagnosis, because almost all psychiatric diagnoses describe symptoms that exist along a spectrum, so almost anyone could meet the DSM5TR criteria for any condition, so long as you ignored the severity of the symptom, and people are often not good at judging the severity of their own symptoms, as they do not know what is \"normal\" in the broader population.\r  \n \r  \nI considered myself moderate on these issues. Every field of medicine faces a tradeoff between overtreatment and undertreatment, and I shared the worries of some of my more trans-affirming colleagues that many of these kids were at high risk for suicide if not given the treatment they wanted. Even if you attribute the increase in trans-identification among teens to merely a social fad, it was a social fad with real dangers. If an influencer or spiritual guru on social media was convincing teens that evil spirits could reside in their left ring finger, and they needed to amputate this finger or consider suicide, the ethical argument could be made that providing these finger amputations was a medically appropriate trade of morbidity for mortality. \"How many regretted hormonal treatments, breast surgeries, or (in our hypothetical) lost ring fingers are worth one life saved from suicide?\" is a reasonable question, even if you are skeptical of the underlying diagnosis.\r  \n \r  \nAnd I was always skeptical of the legitimacy of most teenagers' claims to be transgender, if for no other reason than because gender dysphoria was historically a rare diagnosis, and the symptoms they described could be better explained by other diagnoses. As the old medical proverb says, \"when you hear hoofbeats, think horses and not zebras.\" The DSM5 estimated the prevalence of gender dysphoria in males as a range from 0.005% to 0.014%, and in females as a range of 0.002% to 0.003%, although the newer DSM5TR rightly notes the methodological limitations of such estimates.\r  \n \r  \nRegardless, most of the symptoms these teens described could be explained as identity disturbance (as in borderline personality disorder and some trauma responses), social relationship problems (perhaps due to being on the autism spectrum), body image problems (similar to and sometimes comorbid with eating disorders), rigid thinking about gender roles (perhaps due to OCD or autism), unspecified depression and anxiety, or just gender nonconforming behavior that fell within the normal range of human variation. It seems highly implausible that the entire field of psychiatry had overlooked or missed such high rates of gender dysphoria for so long. Some of my colleagues tried to explain this as being due to the stigma of being transgender, but I do not think it is historically accurate to say that psychiatry as a field has been particularly prudish or hesitant to discuss sex and gender. In 1909 Sigmund Freud published a case report about \"Little Hans,\" which postulated that a 5-year-old boy was secretly fixated on horse penis because of the size of the organ. I do not find it plausible that the next century of psychoanalysis somehow underestimated the true rate of gender dysphoria by multiple orders of magnitude because they were squeamish about the topic. In fact, the concept that young girls secretly wanted a penis was so well known that the term \"penis envy\" entered common English vocabulary! Of course, the psychoanalytic concept of penis envy is not gender dysphoria per se, but it is adjacent enough to demonstrate the implausibility of the notion that generations of psychoanalysts downplayed or ignored the true rate of gender dysphoria due to personal bigotry or cultural taboo.\r  \n \r  \nTherefore, for most of my career I have been in the odd position of doubting my gender-affirming colleagues, who would say \"trans kids know who they are\" and talk about saving lives from suicide, but also believing that they were making the best of a difficult situation. In the absence of any hard outcome data, all we had to argue about was theory and priors. I routinely saw adverse outcomes from these treatments, both people who regretted transitioning and those whose dysphoria and depression kept getting worse the more they altered their bodies, but I had to admit this might be selection bias, as presumably the success cases didn't go on to see other psychiatrists. I could be privately skeptical, but without any hard data there was no public argument to make. The gender affirming clinicians claimed that they could correctly identify which kinds of gender dysphoria required aggressive treatment (from DSMIV-TR to DSM5 the diagnosis was changed to emphasize and require identification with the opposite gender, rather than other kinds of gendered distress and nonconformity), and even when they were wrong they were appropriately trading a risk of long term morbidity for short term mortality. There was nothing to be done except wait for the eventual long term outcomes data.\r  \n \r  \nThe waiting ended when I read the paper \"Psychosocial Functioning in Transgender Youth after 2 Years of Hormones\" by Chen et al in the NEJM. This is the second major study of gender affirming hormones (GAH) in modern pediatric populations, after Tordoff 2022, and it concluded \"GAH improved appearance congruence and psychosocial functioning.\" The authors report the outcomes as positive: \"appearance congruence, positive affect, and life satisfaction increased, and depression and anxiety symptoms decreased.\" To a first approximation, this study would seem to support gender affirming care. Some other writers have criticized the unwarranted causal language of the conclusion, as there was no control group and so it would have been more accurate to say \"GAH was associated with improvements\" rather than \"GAH improved,\" but this is a secondary issue.\r  \n \r  \nThe problem with Chen 2023 isn't its methodological limitations. The problem is its methodological strength. Properly interpreted, it is a negative study of outcomes for youth gender medicine, and its methodology is reasonably strong for this purpose (most of the limitations tilt in favor of a positive finding, not a negative one). Despite the authors' conclusions, an in-depth look at the data they collected reveals this as a failed trial. The authors gave 315 teenagers cross-sex hormones, with lifelong implications for reproductive and sexual health, and by their own outcome measures there was no evidence of meaningful clinical benefit.\r  \n \r  \n315 subjects, ages 12-20, were observed for 2 years, completing 5 scales (one each for appearance, depression, and anxiety, and then two components of an NIH battery for positive affect and life satisfaction) every 6 months including at baseline. The participants were recruited at 4 academic sites as part of the Trans Youth Care in United States (TYCUS) study. Despite the paper's abstract claiming positive results, with no exceptions mentioned, the paper itself admits that life satisfaction, anxiety and depression scores did not improve in male-to-female cases. The authors suggest this may be due to the physical appearance of transwomen, writing \"estrogen mediated phenotypic changes can take between 2 and 5 years to reach their maximum effect,\" but this is in tension with the data they just presented, showing that the male-to-female cases improved in appearance congruence significantly. The rating scale they used is reported as an average of a Likert scale (1 for strong disagreement, 3 for neutral, and 5 for strong agreement) for statements like \"My physical body represents my gender identity\" and so a change from 3 (neutral) to 4 (positive) is a large effect.\r  \n \r  \nIf a change from 3 out of 5 to 4 out of 5 is not enough to change someone's anxiety and depression, this is problematic both because the final point on the scale may not make a difference and because it may not be achievable. Other studies using the Transgender Congruence Scale, such as Ascha 2022 (\"Top Surgery and Chest Dysphoria Among Transmasculine and Nonbinary Adolescents and Young Adults\") show a score of only 3.72 for female-to-male patients 3 months after chest masculinization. (The authors report sums instead of averages, but it is trivial to convert the 33.50 given in Table 2 because we know TCS-AC has 9 items.) The paper that developed this scale, Kozee 2012, administered it to over 300 transgender adults and only 1 item (the first) had a mean over 3.\r  \n \r  \nThese numbers raise the possibility that the male-to-female cases in Chen 2023 may already be at their point of maximal improvement on the TCS-AC scale. A 4/5 score for satisfaction with personal appearance may be the best we can hope for in any population. While non-trans people score a 4.89 on this scale (according to Iliadis 2020), that doesn't mean that a similar score is realistically possible for trans people. When a trans person responds to this scale, they are essentially reporting their satisfaction with their appearance, while a non-trans person is answering questions about a construct (gender identity) they probably don't care about, which means you can't make an apples-to-apples comparison of the scores. If this is counter-intuitive to you, consider that a polling question like \"Are you satisfied with your knowledge of Japanese?\" would result in near-perfect satisfaction scores for those in the general public who have no interest in Japanese (knowledge and desire are matched near zero), but lower scores in students of the Japanese language. Even the best student will probably never reach the 5/5 satisfaction-due-to-apathy of the non-student.\r  \n \r  \nI am frustrated by the authors' decision not to be candid about the negative male-to-female results in the abstract, which is all most people (including news reporters) will be able to read. I have seen gender distressed teenagers with their parents in the psychiatric ER, and many of them are high functioning enough to read and be aware of these studies. While some teens want to transition for personal reasons, regardless of the outcomes data, in much the same way that an Orthodox Jew might want to be circumcised regardless of health benefits, others are in distress and are looking for an evidence-based answer. In the spring of 2023, I had a male-to-female teen in my ER for suicidal ideation, and patient and mother both expressed hopefulness about recently started hormonal treatment, citing news coverage of the paper. This teen had complicated concerns about gender identity, but was explicitly starting hormones to treat depression, and it is unclear whether they would have wanted such treatment without news reporting on Chen 2023.\r  \n \r  \nMoving on to the general results, the authors quantify mental health outcomes as: \"positive affect \\[had an\\] annual increase on a 100-point scale \\[of\\] 0.80 points...life satisfaction \\[had an\\] annual increase on a 100-point scale \\[of\\] 2.32 points...We observed decreased scores for depression \\[with an\\] annual change on a 63-point scale \\[of\\] \u22121.27 points...and decreased \\[anxiety scores\\] annual change on a 100-point scale \\[of\\] \u22121.46 points...over a period of 2 years of GAH treatment.\" These appear to be small effects, but interpreting quantitative results on mental health scales can be tricky, so I will not say that these results are necessarily too small to be clinically meaningful, but because there is no control group these results are small enough to raise concerns about whether GAH outperforms placebo. It is unfortunate that it is not always straightforward to compare depression treatments due to several scales being in common use, but we can see the power of the placebo effect in other clinical trials on depression. In the original clinical trials for Trintellix, a scale called MADRS was used for depression, which is scored out of 60 points, and most enrolled patients had an average depression score from 31-34. Placebo reduced this score by 10.8 to 14.5 points within 8 weeks (see Table 4, page 21 of FDA label). For Auvelity, another newer antidepressant, the placebo group's depression on the same scale fell from 33.2 to 21.1 after 6 weeks (see Figure 3 of page 21 of FDA label).\r  \n \r  \nI won't belabor the point, but anyone familiar with psychiatric research will be aware that placebo effects can be very large, and they occur across multiple diagnoses, including surprising ones like schizophrenia (see Figure 3 of the FDA label for Caplyta). I am genuinely surprised and confused by how minimal this cohort's response to treatment was. Early in my career I thought we were trading the risk of transition regret for great short-term benefit, and I was confused when I noticed how patients given GAH didn't seem to get better. This data confirms my experience is not a fluke. I could go in depth about their anxiety results, which on a hundred-point scale fell by less than 3 points after two years, but this would read nearly identically to the paragraph above.\r  \n \r  \nA more formal analysis of this paper might try to estimate the effects of psychotherapy and subtract them away from the reported benefits of GAH, and an even more sophisticated analysis might try to tease apart the benefits of testosterone for gender dysphoria per se from its more general impact on mood, but I think this is unnecessary given the very small effects reported and the placebo concerns documented above. Putting biological girls on testosterone is conceptually similar to giving men anabolic steroids, and I remain genuinely surprised that it wasn't more beneficial for their mood in the short term. Some men on high doses of male steroids are euphoric to the point of mania.\r  \n \r  \nBut my biggest concerns with this paper are in the protocol. This paper was part of TYCUS, the Trans Youth Care in United States study, and the attached protocol document, containing original (2016) and revised (2021) versions explains that acute suicidality was an exclusion criterion for this study (see section 4.6.4). There were two deaths by suicide in this study, and 11 reports of suicidal ideation, out of 315 participants, and these patients showed no evidence of being suicidal when the study began. This raises the possibility of iatrogenic harm. It would be beneficial to have more data on the suicidality of this cohort, but the next problem is that the authors did not report this data, despite collecting it according to their protocol document.\r  \n \r  \nThe 5 reported outcome measures in Chen 2023 are only a small fraction of the original data collected. The authors also assessed suicidality, Gender Dysphoria per se (not merely appearance congruence), body esteem and body image (two separate scales), service utilization, resiliency and other measures. This data is missing from the paper. I do not fully understand why the NEJM allowed such a selective reporting of the data, especially regarding the adverse suicide events. A Suicidal Ideation Scale with 8 questions was administered according to both the original and revised protocol. In a political climate where these kinds of treatments are increasingly viewed with hostility and new regulatory burdens, why would authors, who often make media appearances on this topic, hide positive results? It seems far more plausible that they are hiding evidence of harm.\r  \n \r  \nOf course, Chen 2023 is not the only paper ever published on gender medicine, but aside from Tordoff 2022 it is nearly the only paper in modern teens to attempt to measure mental health outcomes. The Ascha 2022 paper on chest masculinization surgery I mentioned above uses as its primary outcome a rating scale called the Chest Dysphoria Measure (CDM), a scale that almost any person without breasts would have a low score on (with the possible exception of the rare woman who specifically wants to have prominent and large breasts that others will notice and comment on in non-sexual contexts), even if they experienced no mental health benefits from the breast removal surgery and regretted it. Only the first item (\"I like looking at my chest in the mirror\") measures personal satisfaction. Other items, such as \"Physical intimacy/sexual activity is difficult because of my chest\" may be able to detect harm in a patient who strongly regrets the surgery but is worded in such a way as not to detect actual benefit. They should have left it at \"Physical intimacy/sexual activity is difficult\" because a person without breasts can't experience dysphoria or functional impairment as a result of having breasts, even if their overall functionality and gender dysphoria are unchanged. Gender dysphoria that is focused on breasts may simply move to hips or waist after the breasts are removed.\r  \n \r  \nTordoff 2022 was an observational cohort study of 104 teens, with 7 on some kind of hormonal treatment for gender dysphoria at the beginning of the study and 69 being on such treatment by the end. The authors measured depression on the PHQ-9 scale at 3, 6, and 12 months, and reported \"60% lower odds of depression and 73% lower odds of suicidality among youths who had initiated PBs or GAHs compared with youths who had not.\" This paper is widely cited as evidence for GAH, but the problem is that the treatment group did not actually improve. The authors are making a statistical argument that relies on the \"no treatment\" group getting worse. This would be bad enough by itself, but the deeper problem is that the apparent worsening of the non-GAH group can be explained by dropout effects. There were 35 teens not on GAH at the end of the study, but only 7 completed the final depression scale.\r  \n \r  \nThe data in eTable 3 of the supplement is helpful. At the beginning the 7 teens on GAH and the 93 not on GAH have similar scores: 57-59% meeting depression criteria and 43-45% positive for self-harming or suicidal thoughts. There is some evidence of a temporary benefit from GAH at 3 months, when the 43 GAH teens were at 56% and 28% for depression and suicidality respectively, and the 38 non-GAH teens at 76% and 58%. At 6 months the 59 GAH teens and 24 non-GAH teens are both around 56-58% and 42-46% for depression and suicidality. At 12 months there appears to be a stark worsening of the non-GAH group, with 86% meeting both depression and suicidality criteria. However, this is because 6/7 = 86% and there are only 7 subjects reporting data out of the 35 not on GAH from the original 104 subject cohort. The actual depression rate for the GAH group remains stable around 56% throughout the study, and the rate of suicidality actually worsens from Month 3 to Month 12.\r  \n \r  \nWe cannot assume that the remaining 7 are representative of the entire untreated 35. I suspect teens dropped out of this study because their gender dysphoria improved in its natural course, as many adolescent symptoms, identities and other concerns do. However, even if you disagree with me on this point, the question you have to ask about the Tordoff study is why these 7 teens would go to a gender clinic for a year and not receive GAH. Whatever the reason was, it makes them non-representative of gender dysphoric teens at a gender clinic.\r  \n \r  \nThe short-term effect of GAH is no longer an unanswered question. Its theoretical basis was strong in the absence of data, but like many strong theories it has failed in the face of data. Now that two studies have failed to report meaningful benefit we can no longer say, as we could as recently as 2021, that the short-term benefits are so strong that they outweigh the potential long-term risks inherent in permanent body modification. Some non-trivial number of patients come to regret these body modifications, and we can no longer claim in good faith that there are enormous short term benefits that outweigh this risk. The gender affirming clinicians had two bites at the apple to find the benefit that they claimed would justify these dramatic interventions, and their failure to find it is much greater than I could have imagined two years ago.\r  \n \r  \nI am not unaware of how fraught and politicized this topic has become, but the time has come to admit that we, even the moderates like me, were wrong. When a teenager is distressed by their gender or gendered traits, altering their body with hormones does not help their distress. I suspect, but cannot yet prove, that the gender affirming model is actively harmful, and this is why these gender studies do not have the same methodological problem of large placebo effect size that plagues so much research in psychiatry. When I do in depth chart reviews of suicidal twenty-something trans adults on my inpatient unit, I often see a pattern of a teenager who was uncomfortable with their body, \"affirmed\" in the belief that they were born in the wrong body (which is an idea that, whether right or wrong, is much harder to cope with than merely accepting that you are a masculine woman, or that you must learn to cope with disliking a specific aspect of your body), and their mental health gets worse and worse the more gender affirming treatments they receive. First, they are uncomfortable being traditionally feminine, then they feel \"fake\" after a social transition and masculine haircut, then they take testosterone and feel extremely depressed about \"being a man with breasts,\" then they have their breasts removed and feel suicidal about not having a penis. The belief that \"there is something wrong with my body\" is a cognitive distortion that has been affirmed instead of Socratically questioned with CBT, and the iatrogenic harm can be extreme.\r  \n \r  \nIf we say we care about trans kids, that must mean caring about them enough to hold their treatments to the same standard of evidence we use for everything else. No one thinks that the way we \"care about Alzheimer's patients\" is allowing Biogen to have free rein marketing Aduhelm. The entire edifice of modern medical science is premised on the idea that we cannot assume we are helping people merely because we have good intentions and a good theory. If researchers from Harvard and UCSF could follow over 300 affirmed trans teens for 2 years, measure them with dozens of scales, and publish what they did, then the notion that GAH is helpful should be considered dubious until proven otherwise. Proving a negative is always tricky, but if half a dozen elite researchers scour my house looking for a cat and can't find one, then it is reasonable to conclude no cat exists. And it may no longer reasonable to consider the medicalization of vulnerable teenagers due to a theory that this cat might exist despite our best efforts to find it.\r  \n \r  \n\\-An ABPN Board Certified Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist\r  \n \r  \nPS - To be clear, I support the civil rights of the trans community, even as I criticize their ideas. I see no more contradiction here than, for example, an atheist supporting religious freedom and being opposed to antisemitism. If an atheist can critique both the teachings and practices of hyper-Orthodox Hasidic Judaism, while being opposed to antisemitism at the same time, I believe that I can criticize the ideas of the trans community (\"born in the wrong body\") while still supporting their civil rights and opposing transphobia in all forms.\r  \n\r",

I think many have been skeptical of the increasing politicization of care that should be about the patients and not the ideology.

As a pediatrician at my base, and one who often deals with significant teenage psychiatric comorbidities, I have a vested interest in the topic and a personal notion that something about how we currently perceive and treat all of this is flawed and potentially harmful. It's just unfortunate we often can't have that conversation without shouting from both extreme sides of the argument",

        "text": "Thank you for sharing your perspective. I'm also a psychiatrist (although not CAP) and I agree there are significant limitations in the current evidence base supporting medical interventions for gender dysphoria, especially in minors.\n\nThis is one of those \"emperor with no clothes\" scenarios. Any objective observer would note that there is a lack of high-quality, long-term data on outcomes. Most existing studies rely on small samples, short follow-up periods, convenience sampling, and high loss to follow-up. The few randomized trials have not demonstrated definitive mental health benefits from hormonal or surgical interventions. \n\nOften times, when this is brought up, the knee-jerk response is \"but WPATH guidelines are the standard of care.\" Except WPATH guidelines are not grounded in robust evidence. And those who follow the organization know the changes that have happened in recent years. Former leaders being ousted because they've called for moderation and not jumping into blind affirmation without the evidence base to support that approach. The organization is not a neutral, professional scientific body and that major fact is often glossed over.\n\nOne of the most egregious examples of flimsy evidence guiding policy is the \"US Transgender Survey of 2015.\" This has been cited about 3500 times in the literature and has informed every single US policy impacting transgender life. If you look at the original article, it's a complete joke. They used a grab sampling method. Basically an internet survey with no verification, asking people to invite others to fill out the survey. So a snowball sampling methods, a non-probability sampling method that you can not use to infer conclusions from a wider population. I've looked at the wording of some of the questions, some of the questions seemed almost designed to create demand bias (when the participants are aware of the researcher's aims and thus more likely to answer in a way that supports the investigator's goals). Not to mention, some of the findings are nonsensical. 73% of respondents said they started puberty blockers after the age of 18. Obviously, that's simply not true. \n\nTo be blunt, psychiatry has a checkered history of too hastily adopting novel treatments without adequate study. Compassion for gender dysphoric individuals is important. Recommending irreversible medical interventions in vulnerable populations should require definitive, or at the very least probabilistic, proof of long-term benefit and minimal harm. Currently, that proof does not exist. Truly compassionate, ethical care means applying the same standards of evidence we expect in every other domain of medicine. We can't blindly embrace invasive, irreversible treatments in minors and sacrifice their wellbeing on the altar of ideological agendas or societal pressures.",

        "text": "Prefacing my comments with: I have performed and will continue to perform gender affirming surgeries to consenting trans adults, and I support protecting the civil rights and social acceptance of trans people.\n\nFrom an Ob-Gyn perspective, it has always concerned me the lack of focus on whether or not minors can consent to medications that may severely limit or eliminate their reproductive options later in life. In any patient who I counsel regarding permanent forms of contraception, it is always a very careful process. Additionally, even just for a salpingectomy (where actually patients technically still have the ability to get IVF, so their fertility options are not completely eliminated) Medicaid requires special consent forms signed 30 days before we can even do the surgery, after which time we only have a 6 month window. This is a protective measure to prevent patient coercion.\n\nSo as giving puberty blockers and then cross sex hormones which prevent sexual maturity is a decision that I am not sure a preadolescent has the ability to consent to, from a reproductive standpoint. I understand these are all risk/benefit decisions with parents, patients, and doctors, and I don\u2019t want to minimize the importance of privacy when making medical decisions.\n\nBut at the same time, historically the field of Ob/Gyn has had to reckon with the ethical and societal consequences of giving permanent contraception to patients who either did not consent or could not give appropriate consent. And I hope appropriate guardrails are in place to prevent adolescent psychiatry, and associated fields involved in gender affirming care for minors, from eliminating/limiting fertility options in trans teens and kids, without appropriate consent. We won\u2019t really know the answer to this for another 10+ years.",

I have several patients who go by \"she/they\" pronouns who are entirely unable to articulate why they prefer this to \"she/her\" apart from some extremely vague discomfort with entirely feminine pronouns. I am of course happy to accommodate whatever pronouns they like but it does make me wonder how much of this is social contagion combined with a generalised \"feeling uncomfortable in your own body\" which is entirely normal for those of a certain age group or with certain other (non-gender dysphoria) mental health concerns which would simply self-terminate if not labelled and reinforced.\n\nAt the same time, I somewhat frequently see gender dysphoria as part of a package deal with BPD in crisis (as in not present outside of crises) in my inpatient practice. My approach is often to call them whatever they want to be called, and refer to an outpatient gender clinic - but I wonder how much iatrogenic harm could be caused by a clinician with a different approach.\n\nEdit: /u/sapphireminds, hope this tag is okay as I can't respond to your mod comment - I'd sincerely request you keep this thread up due to the discussion it's spawned, even if OP hasn't kept up their end of the deal to interact.",

    "title": "Elevator Talk: Observational Study of Inappropriate Comments in a Public Space",
    "text": "As someone who's been an observer in this situation, this article was rather interesting. For those who may not have access to the full article I pasted the more juicy parts of the article. I have firsthand observed colleagues in elevators full of other people refer to patients as \"liver bombs\" or \"train wrecks\". yikes. \n\n**Elevator Talk: Observational Study of Inappropriate Comments in a Public Space.** Am J Med\u00a01995 Aug;99(2):190-4\n\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7625424/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7625424/)\n\n>**Comments Violating Patient Confidentiality**\n\n>We observed 18 comments in which hospital employees discussed confidential patient information. Physicians were involved in 11 of these, nurses in 2, other clinicians in 2, and nonclinicians in 2; one commenter could not be identified (Table II). These comments usually took the form of statements such as, \u201cMr. X was readmitted last night for more chemo.\u201d Some comments did not refer to patients by name but provided other identifying information. For example, one passenger referred to a hospitalized patient as \u201cthe Admiral\u201d and another was described as \u201cthe guy who runs company X,\u201d which was a well-known local establishment. Other comments did not involve direct identification of the hospital patient being discussed. On these occasions, the observers noted that the conversations, although not directly violating confidentiality, were so detailed that friends or family overhearing the comments may have been able to identify the patient by the clinical details mentioned. For example, one team of physicians on rounds entered the elevator in the middle of a detailed discussion of a patient\u2019s presenting symptoms, complete with the results of a thallium stress test and the plan for how to proceed. The clinical discussions in these cases were so detailed, even graphic, that they could raise legitimate concerns among passengers regarding the value which health care professionals place on contidentiality. For instance, two physicians had a heated debate discussing the relative merits of removing parts of either one or two lungs from a patient. \n\n>We did not include several comments that disclosed public information, even though they violated patient confidentiality. An example is that, during the time of our study, a local politician received a transplant at one of the hospitals. Because this information could be obtained by watching or reading local news reports, we did not include comments in which passengers discussed his clinical status. If any information about this patient had been discussed that was not public knowledge, it would have been included in our study as inappropriate. We also did not include two violations of patient confidentiality made by nonhospital persons, such as the patient\u2019s friends or relatives discussing the name and medical condition of the patient.\n\n>**Unprofessional Remarks and Motivations**\n\n>We observed 10 comments in which hospital employees talked about themselves in ways that could raise questions about their ability or desire to provide quality care. Nurses were involved in 6 of these comments, physicians in 3, and other clinicians in 1; and 1 commenter could not be identified (this number is greater than 10 because one comment involved a conversation between a physician and a nurse; Table II). Several nurses and physicians complained that they were too tired to do their jobs well. One said: \u201cI worked 16 hours yesterday, went home, had some beer, and before I knew it, I was back here. I don\u2019t think I can make it all night.\u201d On a different ride, a nurse, pushed into the elevator in a wheelchair, was told by another nurse: \u201cYou just can\u2019t assist on those procedures this morning if you\u2019re this sick.\u201d The nurse in the wheelchair replied, with her head in her hands \u201cI have no choice, I have to work.\u201d Several hospital employees argued on the elevator about the correct course of action to take in caring for specific patients. Although it is important to discuss the pros and cons of treatment options, arguing about how to treat a patient while riding an elevator may make passengers nervous about whether clinicians know what they are doing. On two occasions, phyicians riding elevators made it clear that they were biding their time until they could make large amounts of money, raising questions about whether their primary motivations were to provide quality medical care. As one physician said: \u201cThat\u2019s it, I\u2019m getting out of here. I\u2019m going where I can make big bucks. No more running after patients.\u201d Another physician responded by saying: \u201cYou need a magnifying glass to see your paycheck.\u201d \n\n>We did not include several comments that some observers felt were inappropriate. For example, one physician was told to put supplies into a cart and leave it in the hall until morning. The physician replied: \u201cI have to learn to use the stupid thing, so it might as well be tonight.\u201d This comment was thought by the observer to suggest that the person was going to be learning something that, without supervision, might endanger patients. But several members of the research team argued that the physician could just as easily be learning how to use the cart without involving a patient. \n\n>**Comments Raising Questions About Quality of Patient Care**\n\n>We observed eight comments in which hospital employees raised questions about whether the hospital offered good patient care. Nonclinical hospital employees were involved in 5 of these comments, nurses in 1, and in 2 others the commentem could not be identified (Table II). Some comments raised questions about specific providers\u2019 competency. One nurse remarked that another nurse \u201c...must have been on drugs last night; he couldn\u2019t even read a chart.\u201d Other comments raised questions about the hospital\u2019s quality of care without referring to specific employees. For example, a hospital employee spoke to a coworker about an elevator door that closed so quickly that it shut on a wheelchair-bound patient trying to enter. On another ride, two hospital administrators discussed that they had to call the coroner in to see a deceased patient because \u201chis death was the hospital\u2019s fault.\u201d (That comment was made on a packed elevator, causing all other conversation to immediately cease.) On another ride, an African-American woman wearing hospital garb warned three African-American women in street clothes to be careful because \u201cevery tune they see a black person in this hospital, they think they\u2019re stealing something.\u201d \n\n>We characterized these comments as inappropriate because we thought they would make people nervous about the hospital\u2019s quality of care. Some may counter that it is not inappropriate to talk about poor quality of care as long as what one says is truthful. We felt, however, that a hospital elevator is not an appropriate place for this type of discussion, just as it would be inappropriate for a pilot to inform passengers about airplane fatality statistics upon approaching the runway. People coming to visit their loved ones in a hospital are not always in a position to objectively weigh unsubstantiated \u201cinformation\u201d spread through casual conversations among hospital workers. \n\n>We did not include several comments that, although they placed the hospitals or their staff in a negative light, did not raise legitimate concerns about patient care. For instance, on one ride, an elevator passenger complained that a clerical worker \u201cmust have gotten up on the wrong side of the bed yesterday; she was cranky to everyone.\u201d And on several rides, hospital employees escorting patients could be heard uttering profanities. \n\n>**Derogatory Comments About Patients or Their Families**\n\n>We observed 5 derogatory comments about patients or their families. One physician snidely referred to 1 of his patients as \u201cMister Christian Dior,\u201d an allusion to the expensive clothes the patient wore to the hospital. On another ride, a nurse called a patient \u201ca dump.\u201d These comments reflect poorly on the compassion of health care workers. In addition, they may increase visitors\u2019 fears that their loved ones will not receive good medical care if the hospital personnel do not like them. Physicians were involved in 2 of these comments, and nurses in 2; 1 commenter could not be identified (Table II). ",

By focusing on one narrow area you see how different people have approached this question differently. And then you come up with your own study design and analysis plan, and then (BEFORE COLLECTING DATA) go to the statistician to review your study design and analysis plan, and then statistician tells you why your plan is garbage and helps you create a new plan. Then you think well this plan was garbage but I modeled it off of what they did in this other study, so that study is lacking. \n\nIf you keep doing this over and over you start to recognize good and bad studies, and the nuances of different studies. \n\nEven if you don't do research yourself, it seems like you're at an academic center. Is there someone else in the area doing research that you could talk with to see if you could help with a project?\n\nIf that's not possible, could you join a journal club at your institution?

    "title": "Disheartened medical student in the public healthcare system of a developing country",
    "text": "I'm a final year medical student in a developing country. I study at a medical school affiliated with a large public hospital (with a capacity of >2k beds) in a major city. Despite that, the hospital system is extremely overburdened. Our country is densely populated and public hospitals are legally obliged to admit and treat every single patient that turns up. We cannot refer a patient elsewhere even if our beds are all occupied. I often see 2-3 patients in one bed in the wards. The outpatient department is overrun with more patients than the doctors can see, and I see senior residents shouting at the junior ones to go through the patients quicker (for example, to not measure everyone's blood pressure etc). Doctors barely get to spend a minute or two with individual patients. \n\nI want to be clear that even though we are stretched for resources in terms of being understaffed, there is absolutely no dearth of material resources. In this regard, we are lucky, because public hospitals in small towns and peripheral areas suffer from a lack of the most basic resources- gloves, gauze, syringes etc. \n\nThere is no shortage of any basic medical equipment here, and the government provides us an unlimited supply for free. No patient is ever to pay for any medicine or treatment availed at the hospital. Only for a few medicines and procedures that cannot be performed at the hospital do patients visit a private pharmacy or an alternate hospital where they might have to pay out of their pocket. \n\nMuch of the work here is performed by first year post-graduate residents and interns (who also do all the scut work that the supporting staff ideally should have done). Senior residents supervise and consultants are not frequently around.\n\nI understand the limitations of our system, and in some ways my distress is assuaged knowing I may be able to help the underprivileged masses by studying and working here during my internship year. \n\nIn terms of ability to treat a disease, the doctors here are excellent. They are some of the brightest people of our country, most of them have worked extremely hard to get here and they've had so much practice in our high-volume setup that they really know what they're doing. However, I'm extremely disheartened by the inhumane way our patients are treated in the system. \n\nI have seen invasive procedures such as lumbar punctures (once with >10 failed attempts), and thoracocentesis performed without any local anesthetic. Predictably, the patients howl in pain. Many a times, aseptic precautions are not followed AT ALL. We've seen nurses and doctors picking up intravenous catheters (bare needles) from the grimy floor and using them on the patients. The local site is not sterilised with alcohol before a tap. \n\nThe post operative patients in the surgical wards are often in a lot of pain. Sometimes, more than twenty medical students are present inside a single operation theatre at once. We bring our own scrubs and slippers, which means that there is effectively no guarantee of asepsis around the area. \n\nThe labour rooms are the worst. No one treats their patients as badly as the OBGYNs. Every member of the staff, from the doctors to the nurses and attendants shout and scream at the mothers for every little thing. Mothers are routinely scolded for having too many children, and showing up at the hospital for the fifth time with another kid on the way.\n\nAn epidural or any other anesthesia is never offered during normal vaginal deliveries. The mothers are alone in the labour room and no attendants are allowed. Non-emergency episiotomies are performed without local anesthesia. I've witnessed resident doctors stitching up large vaginal tears without anesthesia. The women are strongly rebuked for crying in pain. \n\nI do not understand why the doctors behave the way they do. We do have the resources to administer anesthesia and to maintain sterility. Like I mentioned earlier, we are very well equipped compared to public hospitals in the rest of the country. The only explanation I can come up with is that the doctors are brutally over-worked and have stopped caring altogether. During intern year, shifts lasting 30+ hours are not uncommon. We hear from our seniors that our postgraduate residents practically live in the hospital. They only get to sleep for about 4 hours about every other day. They are allowed no weekends or public holidays off work. It's work 7 days a week and 365 days a year. \n\nI've lost much of my motivation to become a doctor after witnessing such distressing scenes. I'm anxious about going to the hospital, even though I must every day. I feel hopeless, because I know that in a year, I will be an intern at this same hospital and might be expected to treat patients the same way. \n\nThere is no way to escape witnessing what I see every day. I've resolved to treat my patients humanely when I come to it, but I'm afraid that I will turn into a inhumane, cruel doctor when I've been in such a stressful and toxic environment for too long. \n",

        "text": "I was born and grew up in an undeveloped country like the one you described. However my family immigrated to United States when I was very young so I grew up, was educated and work in the US healthcare system.\n\n\nWe have our own issues here of course. We're the richest country in the world and yet millions of our citizens do not have health insurance or access to care. Healthcare is often a for-profit enterprise here so that doctors are also pressured to see many patients in a short time and so cannot offer the best care that they could. At the same time we can be sued if patients are unsatisfied with our care even if nothing technically wrong was done and the case might not go to court. However I don't think we have the same degree or necessarily the same types of challenges that you probably face in your country.\n\n\nWhen I was in your position in training I also had a year or two where I felt very cynical about medicine and the healthcare system. But I recovered from that largely over time.\n\n\n1) Realize that training is not forever. It's a finite amount of time. I know for me lack of sleep for example probably made me more irritable than I usually am. At the time I trained the US did not have restrictions on hours in the same they way they do now. When you're young it's easy to lose perspective. So don't take your few years of experience to represent most or even all of your career in medicine.\n\n\n2) Although there are constraints, ultimately you decide how you practice. Just because people around you are cruel or unempathetic to others doesn't mean you have to be. I remember being yelled at by attendings as a medical student and then a resident for no clear reason. I decided that that was not who I wanted to be when I grew up.\n\n\n\u00a0By the time I was a fellow, I remember reporting an attending for yelling at my intern in public. That attending had a bad reputation in the nurses supported my report. He ended up being suspended for months and sent to anger management class.\u00a0\n\n\nOccasionally I teach medical students graduate students and medical trainees. Some of my most gratifying experiences have been when people compliment me on my teaching.\u00a0\n\n\n3) Look for the good and the small wins. It's very easy to focus on the negative to the degree that we don't see the positive. I remember being frustrated at my patients for not complying with my recommendations.\u00a0\n\n\nBut in fact some did. For example the lady who spoke no English learned how to take care of her husband's dressings through my teaching her via pictures. Another one of my patients stopped using cocaine after multiple hospitalizations and talks with her about the dangers of the substance. When my training program ended and I left to go to another state, I was surprised by the number of patients who brought me cards and small gifts thanking me for my care.\u00a0\n\n\nI had some professors that no matter how tired or busy they were treated every patient and every staff member with respect. So I made them my role models. If you grow up and become a medical professor you can be that role model for your students and trainees.\n\n\n4) Now that you've seen and identify the problems in your healthcare system think about how you can improve them. After my training and several years of practice I went\u00a0 to public health school and obtained a degree in health services research. I did it because the problems I was seeing and trying to solve had to be approached from a systemic level and not from my individual role as a physician.\u00a0\n\n\nI've been involved in medical education and improving clinic processes in my local community and nationally. Although there are often challenges it's also gratifying to see improvements when they happen. You have to have patience. Some of the projects I've been involved with took 10 to 15 years to finally be implemented. But they could potentially positively affect millions of patients if successful.\n\n\nIf I sound like an optimist it is because I am. For several years in my 20s, I was a pessimist but I decided that pessimism was futile. It doesn't solve anything, doesn't make me feel any better, and doesn't motivate me to do anything. So I decided to look into optimism. Keep in mind this is not blind optimism. I am practical about the barriers and obstacles I will face. In fact for every project I think about the worst that can happen and try to prevent or alleviate it. If you get a chance read about realistic optimism.",

    "title": "Doctors make the worst (fake) patients",
    "text": "While more relevant to any other doctors lurking here, I have a funny story from work. For context, I'm a doctor from India, who, having passed one heap of British medical exams, and is still recuperating (and losing sleep) from the residency matching process for another, happens to be working at one of the more prestigious hospitals back at home. In India, almost all of our own exams, including from med school, involve actual bona fide sick people, even the more fancy ones. \n\nI turned up, as usual, only to find my ward crammed with dozens of obviously senior doctors and not a patient in sight. And I didn't sign up for any medical conferences, I only attend them if there's a buffet table and booze.\n\nTurns out the MRCP PACES exam, which, as the acronym would suggest, provides membership to the Royal College of Physicians in the UK (basically internists, but sounds cooler), was being conducted there. It involves somewhat more involved cases and more tricky diagnoses than what I had to endure in my own British OSCEs. And which I hope to never have to give myself, since I just want to be a fucking shrink, I don't care to palpate your liver, no, not even if I'm seeing you after a paracetamol overdose. Palpating the fake prosthetic tiddies on a grinning male actor while doing my best to look in the eyes (up there, no, more to the left) the actress who supposedly had a breast lump somewhere in there takes most of the fun out of it. \n\nAnd nobody had told me. Cue me gingerly creeping to the doctor's room, which kept getting invaded by yet more cute postgrad trainees/residents. I'm not one to complain about that, but I really wanted some goddamn sleep.\n\nEventually, I spotted a girl feverishly reading MRCP station notes, and I enquired politely about them only to be told she wasn't giving the exam herself.\n\nHuh?\n\nLike, I'm not the most passionate doctor around, but it's pretty rare to study for an exam you're not fucking giving.\n\nTurns out that in lieu of highly trained professional actors fluent in English, as is the case in the UK, at least as far as I can recall my friends telling me, or by googling it myself, they just recruit the medicine residents in India. \n\nWell, it must be fun to be on the other end of the poking and prodding. I recall them chatting about how one poor bastard had to endure some particularly painful tests, and had to do his absolute best to avoid wincing as his abdomen was molested in an effort to find something wrong with his perfectly normal kidneys. Why? Because the test *wasn't* supposed to be painful, and if he did show his pain, that would be interpreted as an intentional clinical sign by the examinees, who not having access to the script, would then promptly jump to the wrong diagnosis and thus immediately fail the station.\n\nFunnier still were the ophthalmological exams, since a few of the over-qualified patients had visual issues of their own, and the imaginary platonic ideal of the disease they were supposed to embody didn't. One of them found out he had a heart murmur the hard way, which has to suck, but I heard that the examiners did end up agreeing to pass the people who noticed that particular divergence from fiction.\n\nWell, I guess it beats seriously ill patients being subjected to the same, it's a bit awkward when they die on you or have to be shifted to the ICU mid exam, really wreaks havoc on the grading. Well, I've no intention of giving the MRCP, but it was sure funny to just sit there and munch popcorn as the bacon was made, until someone guilt-tripped me into admitting my lack of productive work to my boss and I was reassigned to another ward for the week. Eh, it was good while it lasted. If I do ever give it for the lols, I'll hope the 'patient' takes pity on me or wants respite from my fumbling, and just whispers the diagnosis to me instead. They'd probably know better. ",

    "text": "I saw a comment listing some studies showing low persistence - in the interest of good faith discussion I've reposted it here with links, and included studies of high persistence as well to provide a balanced perspective. I would love to see any more such studies from both sides. I'm interested in methodological limitations of these studies, what is leading them to conclude different things, and how this should impact our practice. In the interest of good faith discussion I'd like to acknowledge that there is a solid proportion of desistance and negative mental health outcomes associated with not the diagnosis of gender dysphoria itself, but with the stigma and their treatment by the community. Regardless of your views on gender medicine, I think we can all agree that these people deserve grace and to be treated with kindness and respect.\n\nFor context, I see transgender individuals as patients but not particularly their gender-related concerns.

And [here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15532739.2018.1468293) is a response to this. I can't speak on the merits of these.\n\n**High persistence**\n\n[\"High persistence in Spanish transgender minors: 18 years of experience of the Gender Identity Unit of Catalonia\"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1888989122000283) - 97.6% persistence at median follow-up of 2.6 years, though they also comment on other literature showing low persistence.\n\n[\"Gender Identity 5 Years After Social Transition\"](https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/150/2/e2021056082/186992/Gender-Identity-5-Years-After-Social-Transition) - 94% continued to identify as binary transgender 5 years post-social transition.\n\n\n**Low persistence**\n\n[Kelley Drummond, Susan J Bradley, Michele Peterson-Badali, and Kenneth J Zucker. 2008. \u201cA Follow-up Study of Girls with Gender Identity Disorder.\"](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18194003/) - 3/25 girls continued to identify as transgender.\n\n[Madeleine Wallien and Peggy T.

        "text": "The most opaque and interesting part of the medical conception of gender dysphoria as a medical issue is, to me, trying to understand where the intersection is between the social and the biological.\n\nIt makes sense to me that people would have varying levels of attachment to the performative aspects of gender roles. As a person born biologically male, there's a lot about \"being a man\" that I simply don't care about. I'm not interested in performative aggression, or working on cars, or avoiding talking about flowers or feelings. I don't really care what someone identifies me as, so long as they're not using it as a pejorative.\n\nIt makes sense that some of this has some tie to physiology. I can conceive of parts of the brain that make one more prone to aggressive reactions to stimuli, or having the desire to dominate social situations, or parts of the brain that predispose one to be sexually forward.\n\nIt doesn't really make sense to me that things such as your clothing preferences and your hobbies would originate from biology. I can see a connection between say, cars being loud and aggressive, and a \"male\" desire to express aggression and confidence. But beating people in chess is also a show of dominance and superiority, and you can swagger just as much on the dance floor as you can in a gym. It doesn't seem intuitive that being male has to present the way that it does now, as opposed to some other way that has the same \"underlying biological sentiments\", if that concept has any meaning.\n\nIt does make sense to me that someone could feel like their body is wrong. It makes intuitive sense that if something like phantom-limb syndrome exists, then one could feel like they should have a penis, or should have breasts, and are dissatisfied that they don't. But the social aspect, the behaviors and way of dressing and way of speaking, feel like they fall much less under this umbrella.\n\nAll that in mind, it's hard to understand how transgender people fit into this. Because to be transgender, it's not enough to not want to be male, if you're AFAB, or to not want to be female, if you're AMAB. People on the transgender spectrum have something of a need to be identified as members of the opposite gender, with what seems to be a large amount of gender performativity. \n\nThis part simply doesn't make much sense to me. It's possible to not be male and not wear dresses, and it's just as possible to be female and not wear dresses. I've never really understood how the need to assert one's underlying gender conception on others could be rooted in a medical condition, in and of itself. Just as how it doesn't feel like there's a part of my male brain that insists I watch football (which I don't), it doesn't seem like there would exist a part of my brain that might insist that I do yoga (even though I did for quite some time). It feels intuitively like the performative aspects of gender expression are more socially informed than they are biologically informed.\n\nI'd love for someone with more knowledge/understanding to expand on my perspective on this.",

I commend you for trying to present data from multiple sources but would greatly recommend you investigate the sources of your data before presenting this as an instance of true controversy in the literature. \n\nKenneth Zucker, who is the senior author of your first and last source, is incredibly controversial. The data you present come from a center in Toronto where he essentially forced children into \u201cconversion therapy\u201d with the explicit goal of preventing them from being transgender adults. The way this was done was by forcing them to conform to gender roles associated with their assigned sex at birth, family therapy in which the children were explicitly told that gender transition would hurt their family, and the ways in which they personally would be harmed and socially ostracized if they chose to be transgender. The clinic where the studies above were undertaken was closed in 2015 after accusations of child abuse. \n\n(There have also been accusations, which he has denied, that he is attempting to extinguish homosexual behavior in these children, to which he devotes a significant portion of the discussion of the 2021 article to attempting to refute) \n\nAs the follow up was conducted with the same investigators I highly doubt that the results are meaningful at all. I would imagine that most children enrolled in such a program would tell these investigators that they are no longer trans regardless of their true gender identity. \n\nI would argue the above sources are irrelevant to your clinical question which is whether gender dysphoria is persistent over time. \n\nThese studies don\u2019t actually evaluate relevant outcomes such as patient satisfaction with life, which I believe is much more useful to your patients.",

But I feel like there's an elephant in the room I can't leave alone.  \n\n\nThe choice faced by gender medicine as a whole is not 'to give GAC or not to give GAC', but 'provide them with what they want or let them get it on their own.' Self-medication with gender affirming hormones and body modifications is not unheard of today and was never unheard of at any particular point in the past, at least going back to Aristotle.   \n\n\nGuides exist for DIY HRT and they're findable with the click of a button. In the modern age of social media, stopping the spread of such information or the(supposed or actual) social contagion that comes with it is completely impossible. In places that are banning gender affirming care, such guides are already commonplace. Medical professionals are not the gatekeepers of transgender care, they are the compromise that avoids a worse outcome, and were thrust into the role of gender arbiter by accident.  \n\n\nThe outcomes for self-medicating people obviously can't really be known in a proper study, but I hope it's uncontroversial that modern gender medicine provides better and safer outcomes than a wild west of orchi sheds and grey market pharmaceuticals. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWould some people be dissuaded from pursuing gender affirming care if they couldn't receive it from a medical professional? Yes, definitely. Is giving up a better outcome for them than if proper care were available? That's much more murky, but at least my own moral compass points to 'no'. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA few months back I picked up someone who had performed an orchiectomy on themself. They talked a bit about why on the way to the ER; they felt like the two-year waiting list they were on to get gender affirming surgery was too long, felt the procedure would be banned by then. Didn't seem distraught(besides the pain) or like they weren't alert and oriented. I guess it's come back to my thoughts now and then.

You may be misled by relying on a manual band count instead of other more modern, precise results like automated ANC, immature granulocyte counts, CRP or Procalcitonin.\n\nThe band neutrophil count is a manually performed test with huge variability from tech to tech.  You can take the same slide and have multiple techs do a manual differential and get wildly different band results.   This is due to many factors including the number of cells counted (typically only 100 on a manual differential), subjective interpretation (what is a band and what is not) and other factors associated with a manual test.   I\u2019ve seen studies where band results from different techs on the same slide can range from 2% all the way up to 20%.   (Think about that the next time you get a patient where the band result doesn\u2019t match the clinical picture.)\n\nAutomated cell counts like absolute neutrophil counts or absolute immature granulocyte counts are based on counting 10,000 or more WBCs.  CRP and procalcitonin are also automated and standardized, removing the variability associated with a manual test. As such, the results are vastly more accurate and precise than a manual band count.\n\nHere are some nice articles about band counts  and the issues associated with them.\n\nOne of my favorites is by Dr Joanne Cornbleet at Stanford \u201cClinical Utility of the Band Count\u201d.   Dr Cornbleet discusses the technical issues with band counts as well as their clinical utility (or lack thereof) in a variety of conditions.\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11933571/\n\n\u201cBeyond Bands: The Immature Granulocyte Count\u201d This also explains the issues associated with bands and the benefits of the automated IG (immature granulocyte) count many of you may already see in your automated CBC/ differential.  (The author has some nice clinical case studies as well.)\n\nhttps://labmedicineblog.com/2018/09/17/beyond-bands-the-immature-granulocyte-count/\n\n\u201cDoes the band cell survive the 21st century?\u201d They describe the variability of band counts from a study done with 157 hospital labs in the Netherlands.\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16412143/\n\nBecause of the issues associated with poor reliability of the manual band count, more and more labs are not reporting them anymore.   They want clinicians to rely on the more accurate automated counts as well as other tests like CRP and procalcitonin.",

    "title": "Why don\u2019t many Doctors accept the evidence around the harms of vaping?",
    "text": "As the title suggests, amongst my medical colleagues, many of them have expressed the view that vaping is just as, if not more, harmful than smoking tobacco - despite significant scientific and common sense evidence for the contrary. Scientifically, the best evidence available is probably this study -[E-cigarettes: an evidence update - GOV.UK](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5b6c3f57ed915d30f140f822/Ecigarettes_an_evidence_update_A_report_commissioned_by_Public_Health_England_FINAL.pdf) which was again updated in 2022 with an additional [7 years of data to analyse.](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/633469fc8fa8f5066d28e1a2/Nicotine-vaping-in-England-2022-report.pdf) Since the first study is 113pages and the update is 1,468 pages, the important takeaways can be viewed [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nicotine-vaping-in-england-2022-evidence-update/nicotine-vaping-in-england-2022-evidence-update-main-findings) - or you can just read the Royal College of Physician's 2016 report [Nicotine Without Smoke: Tobacco harm reduction](https://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/sites/default/files/media/Documents/Nicotine%20without%20smoke.pdf) which summarises things nicely:\n\n>From first principles, we would expect repeated and sustained inhalation of the generally low concentrations of particulates, oxidants,\ncarcinogens and other constituents to pose some risks to health, particularly inrelation to COPD and lung cancer. However, the absolute magnitude of any riskattributable to e-cigarette use is likely to be very small in absolute terms, andhence substantially smaller than that arising from tobacco smoking. \n\n>A recent evidence review concluded that e-cigarette vapour can contain some of the toxinspresent in tobacco smoke, but at much lower levels, and that the long-term health effects of e-cigarette use, although unknown, are likely to be much less, if at all, harmful to users or bystanders than cigarette smoke. \n\n>An analysis basedon expert opinion quantified the likely harm to health and society of e-cigarettes at about 5% of the burden caused by tobacco smoking,112 and arecent report by Public Health England supported this conclusion. With appropriate product standards to minimise toxin and contaminant exposure in e-cigarette vapour, it should be possible to reduce risks of physical health still further. It is also possible, although unlikely, that other, unexpected harm from inhaling e-cigarette vapour over the longer term might yet emerge.\n\n>Although it is not possible to quantify the long-term health risks associated with\ne-cigarettes precisely, the available data suggest that they are unlikely to exceed5% of those associated with smoked tobacco products, and may well be substantially lower than this figure.\n\nYet as many of the above linked papers also discuss, public perceptions - especially in australia, where i practice - lay far afield from the reality of the situation, and all too often i find that others in health also share this misconception. On a population level, the harm and suffering unnecesarily caused by these misconceptions are, at a population level, heartbreaking. I have spoken to numerous patients who had considered switching from tobacco to vaping, but had been told by a health professional that it was likely just as bad, and so stuck with what was comfortable. These sometimes throwaway comments can have real world consequences and i think its important that as doctors we practice evidence based medicine, and the evidence says that any current smoker should be encouraged to at least switch to vaping, which from there increases their chance of quitting drastically.",

        "text": "Popular discourse is bad at examining multiple axes. Doctors aren't always better, but also nuance from doctors gets lost in public discourse.\n\nAre e-cigarettes/vaping effective and safe as tools for smoking cessation? Yes, I find the evidence convincing. They work for cessation of *smoking tobacco*, and they are less bad than tobacco. But then, it's hard to come up with anything short of huffing organic solvents that is more chronically bad than smoking, and I might be doing solvents a disservice. At any rate, the evidence looks like they outperform patches, gum, inhalers, and all the rest of the NRT pantheon in getting people to stop putting cigarettes in their mouths, and that's a win. With an asterisk.\n\nAre e-cigarettes/vaping safe *in general*? Again, better than cigarettes. Generally pretty safe. Not perfect. As a harm reduction strategy, absolutely. As a general recommendation, no, don't take up vaping for your health.\n\nAre e-cigarettes/vaping good as a matter of public policy? There I'm much more concerned. They show good efficacy as an initiation of nicotine intake that progresses to tobacco\u2014not just the reverse. Having kids vape is not good in part because setting kids up to smoke is not good.\n\nAre e-cigarettes/vaping good for nicotine cessation? Here's that asterisk. If there's evidence, it's a lot less robust. The purpose of NRT generally is to quit smoking and then quit NRT. People struggle to quit vaping. Vaping forever is better than a pack a day for the next five decades, but it's not ideal. Maybe it's a better transition than straight from cigarettes to patches/gum/lozenges, but I'd want to see evidence for that. If the options are traditional NRT with a lower success rate but a higher nicotine abstinence rate 12 months in versus e-cigarettes with better success but then continued vaping... I don't know. Recommending vaping out of the gate seems wrong. A trial or two of old NRT and then vaping as harm reduction? The right answer isn't obvious.\n\nMaybe vaping is a good form of MAT for nicotine use. I certainly don't advocate against buprenorphine or methadone. But the response rates for those are so good, and the abstinence rates without them so dismal, that I hesitate to draw immediate comparison.",

Therefore evidence showing that it is less harmful than smoking shows that it can be beneficial in this group.\nIn the other hand, Australia has had a rather effective public health response to smoking and has manage to reduce smoking prevalence quite a lot in the community. As a paediatrician, I mainly come across vape use in adolescents who are not using it as a step down from smoking but as a step up into nicotine use. While yes it\u2019s probably better that a kid who was going to start smoking goes vaping instead, the explosion of vaping in recent years shows that many young people who would otherwise not have smoked at all, are now becoming addicted to nicotine because of the availability and attractiveness of vaping. \n\nYou have spoken about the harms of negative views towards vaping on a population level- but I would say that at the population level, there is a much greater risk of increasing uptake of nicotine use in teens than there is in not fully accessing one of many smoking cessation strategies in adults with nicotine addiction.",

    "text": "I am currently finishing my first year residency in FM and I think I might be going through a bit of a crisis. Obviously I didn't go to med school for the paycheck but in my country residents get around 20k a year after taxes. It doesn't get much better when you become a specialist. On top of that, our healthcare system is going down the drain and every year things just get substantially worse for doctors. The prospects are just awful for our free health care system and with the impending exodus to private medicine, the working conditions are bound to get worse there as well.\n  \nAgain, I'm not focusing on the money, but the gratification at the end of the day just seems smaller and smaller for the amount of work, responsibility and obligation to stay updated.\n  \nAll of this is affecting my mental health. I started med school late in life and it's not really an option to change lanes completely at 40 years old. Right now, I'm pretty much questioning if I should even finish my residency, since the idea of just doing clinical consultations seems emotional draining.\n  \nI have a ton of interests outside of the medical field and sometimes I find myself resenting my job for being so absorbing.\n  \nNow that my vent is over (and thank you for bearing with me), I would like to ask for some advice. Is there anything the I could invest in that is related to medicine but not solely clinical? Medical liaison? Medical writing? I'm even considering something like medical-related programming. Something that could occupy maybe half my week and then give me enough time to explore other interests.\n  \nWould also love to hear from someone who went/is going through something similar.\n  \nEDIT: \nWhen I wrote this, it was during the last days of my vacation. I ended up using that \"free time\" to study for the upcoming exam and to prepare the reports that we are supposed to present at the end of our first year. So I was incredibly frustrated.. \nWhen I got back to work I went into automatic mode and stopped overthinking about my current and future situation in medicine. That included replying and thanking everyone for their suggestions. \nSorry for that. And thank you for taking some time of your day to offer some advice to a fellow colleague. \n\nMoving abroad seems very much like an option now. I think that in 3 years the emigration policies might have changed in some of the countries that where suggested so I will have to re-evaluate when I finish my residency. Might even learn a new language to increase my options in the meantime.\nIt's also worth mentioning... I was told that some patients asked for me and were disappointed because I was away. It seems small but that really helped me go back to work the next day.",

Try to make it work for a few more years, focus on good parts (e.g. patient relationships) and stay healthy while doing it (exercise, sleep, nutrition, friends/family).

    "text": "Few months into my emergency medicine posting as a PGY2 and I\u2019ve seen\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- First case of GCS 3 + bilaterally dilated pupils in 45 yo smoker but non drinker. No significant PMH or chronic meds. Initial CTB 3h after onset of giddiness + gcs drop was reported as no abnormalities. Suspicion of ?drug overdose as patient went smoking after a family event, family unsure of what he smoked. Tox was consulted and impression of ?sympathetomimetic drug overdose was given. Patient still not improving after few hours. 9 hours post symptom onset, decision was made by senior attending to order a CTA before sending patient up because \u201cthere\u2019s only 2 things we can\u2019t miss in GCS drop i.e NCSE non convulsive status epilepticus and basilar artery occlusion. Everything else can be sorted out by the inpatient team.\u201d Final diagnosis basilar artery occlusion. Telemetry picked out AF, mechanism cardioembolic. Case went to M&M.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Second case of GCS 3 + bilaterally dilated pupils in 50 yo pt with hx of IVDA. Happened few weeks after first case above. ED senior attending was afraid to miss basilar artery occlusion after the first case went to M&M, decided to order CT + CTA, justifying that with \u201cbilateral plantars upgoing\u201d. Stroke team came, saw the stroke registrar pick up her phone to speak with the stroke consultant for over 5 minutes. Decision made by stroke team to intubate and organise stat MRI TRO thalamic infarct after CTA was negative for large vessel occlusion (in a patient with known IVDA history!!) MRI was obviously negative for stroke. Next day Urine drug screen positive for multiple drugs. Final diagnosis drug overdose\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Third case of GCS 3 + bilaterally dilated pupils in 32 yo factory worker. Hx of shirt getting caught in machinery. Deep abrasions noted around neck and shoulder region. Face and neck flushed and mildly oedematous. Petechial looking marks only over face and neck region. Initial hypothesis of neck strangulation by shirt being caught by machinery, resulting asphyxiation and hypoxic injury to brain leading to bilaterally dilated pupils and GCS 3. Facial flushing, edema and petechiae together with neck and shoulder abrasions suggests venous outflow obstruction due to neck extrinsic compression.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIm sure there are other causes of AMS with bilaterally dilated pupils e.g anticholinergic poisoning, sympathethomimetic poisoning etc. But how would one distinguish between central causes i.e  basilar artery occlusion vs systemic i.e drug overdose?I\u2019ve been thinking about this issue, specifically how to distinguish between case 1 and 2. Sure you could use things like pretest probability e.g age, vascular risk factors and hx of IVDA use. ECG features like prolonged QRS/QTC, signs like diaphoresis etc, coma exam e.g VOR testing, watching for asymmetry in facial grimacing in response to pain to test CN7. But in posterior circulation typically these are high risk for cardioembolic mechanism which would occur in young patients, so you can\u2019t just say patient is low risk of BAO just because of young age and lack of vascular risk factors. And they tend to have bilateral cerebellar and brainstem infarcts giving rise to bilateral neurological signs. Similarly, IVDA users tend to have poor lifestyle and health choices, they typically have risk factors for stroke too, calling it drug overdose would probably be right 99% of the time. But to borrow a term from investing, that would be akin to picking pennies in front of a steamroller. You are right 99.9% of the time, but the 0.1% of the time you get it wrong, that could be career ending move.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI briefly recall back in medical student days studying during my ophthalmology posting about pilocarpine 1% drops used to distinguish between pharmacology and CN3 pupils. If pilocarpine constricts pupils, unlikely pharmacological pupils e.g anticholinergic overdose and more likely CN3 pupils suggesting central cause. But I\u2019m not sure if ophthalmologists even use pilocarpine drops for such purpose and they would probably rely on things like ptosis and ophthalmoplegia more than pilocarpine eye drop testing (which would be impractical in basilar artery occlusion with GCS 3 since these tends to be bilateral infarcts and patient would not be able comply with much neuro exam at all).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the value of bilateral dilated pupils in context of depressed GCS? Would use of pilocarpine drops be useful? How would you approach these cases? Indiscriminate CT + CTA then intubation followed by STAT MRI stroke protocol seems to be too resource intensive and I\u2019m not sure if all hospitals can support that",

It even burned a nurse during the surgical removal of a reactivated particle. Interesting case study, although there seems to be some newer literature that suggests that the use of copper sulfate to visualize particles actually doesn't result in better outcomes and may in fact lead to a poorer prognosis (I saw a review somewhere but I can't find it).",

I live in the Sacramento area, it's actually a happening place where a lot of people are moving, but a number of my patients can't get into a primary care physician for 3 months if they have Cadillac insurance, more if they have one of the many plans that have been dropped by most systems in my area.  The state expanded Medicaid coverage massively last year, but both pcps and specialty  offices aren't taking Medicaid for the most part other than already overburdened FQHCs.  Kaiser got a nice cushy contract with the state to supply Medicaid coverage, but patients already in the Kaiser system already struggle to get in with their PCPs and if they need a specialist it's an added struggle. When I did locums last year I paid for kaiser. I was not able to get into a primary and kaiser refused to pay for my adhd medication because I didn't have a kaiser psychiatrist, which likely would have taken over a year to establish. I certainly felt like I was cheated out of thousands of dollars, paying a monthly premium for insurance and not even being able to access services, but I can't say i was particularly surprised. The public as a whole seems to be absolutely blindsided when they really need medical care and get turned away at every corner because there aren't enough doctors to take care of them and none of the hospitals in the area want to deal with their insurance.",

    "text": "New rheumatology attending job, got a lot of low +ANA/+RF patients that had vaguer symptoms but were distressed enough to climb the cancellation line.\n\nPreviously healthy Type-A women (usually with acute decline confirmed by their partners and most with professional careers), mid 20s or early 50s like most other autoimmune diseases, with 2-4 years of symptoms:\n\n* Self-identifying COVID as a trigger (especially if pregnant during Covid infection), some having gone to a \"long covid\" clinics and tried SSRIs, SNRIs, often having tried NSAIDs, gabapentin, or muscle relaxers;\n* Severe fatigue, sicca symptoms, puffiness (though usually not really true synovitis) to wrists and MCPs\n* New onset of eczematous rashes or urticaria (with photos showing it) and dry skin and brittle hair/nails\n* A sort of small fiber neuropathy (burning/pins and needles/electrical sensation, not just numbness/poor grip/carpal tunnel) that about 1/5 of them had even already had an EMG that returned normal (which if small-fiber would be expected).\n* Fam Hx of RA, lupus, thyroid disease (usually if identified was Hashimoto's), occasionally Sjogren's, and in some cases significant family history of lymphoma or MGUS. Sometimes if referred from heme/onc (seen there for elevated WBCs/Plts then found to be ANA+) they had a slightly abnormal SPEP themselves.\n* Almost uniformly deficient on Vit D or B12 or iron (or all 3) w/ a recent history of dyspepsia, GERD, abdominal pain, bloating; many had a high ferritin on their iron profiles as well seemingly indicating inflammation. Some having had EGD w/ biopsies showing nonspecific inflammatory changes and occasionally microscopic colitis if they had a colonoscopy;\n* Several had even had their optometrist, ophthalmologist, or dentist refer them on with a specifically voiced concern for Sjogren's or dry eyes or mouth w/ significant dental disease\n\nFellowship didn\u2019t focus on Sjogren\u2019s much, so I dug into a lot of legitimate resources, saw a high prevalence of atrophic gastritis, thyroiditis, and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency commonly repeated in Sjogren's cases going back from the 70s till today, and I started doing a few things (if their symptoms from above warranted it only), like checking:\n\n* SS-A/SS-B (if it wasn't already checked, or if they were ANA neg) along with the \"Early Sjogren's Panel\"\n* Parietal Cell Ab and Intrinsic Factor Ab, and B12/Folate/Iron/Vit D depending on MCV\n* TPO/Thyroglobulin Abs\n* Pancreatic Elastase\n\nAnd now I'm seeing a lot of these come back abnormal, at a higher rate than I'd expect. And if it was just SS-A positive patients (who also happened to have the other antibodies show up) that would be one thing. But I'm seeing it in a lot of SSA \\*negative\\* patients, which by current ACR criteria don't get classified as Sjogren's (or at least not yet without a biopsy).\n\nI offered Hydroxychloroquine to them if they had more peripheral arthritis (and a few of these did have power Doppler signal on MSK ultrasound), and probably 2/3 of the Early Sjogren's Positive patients had pretty dramatic improvement with joint pains and brain fog, usually the highest titer ones. If they still had joint pains and more swelling, I later I added low dose leflunomide which helped (after the more recent ACR-reported results of LEF+HCQ being a useful combo that can impact sicca symptoms) or MTX, and usually got them to good control of their symptoms.\n\nThe thing that's blown my mind is that several have been able to go back to work and report that they're essentially back to normal without any brain fog or peripheral neuropathy anymore, or managed w/ just a smidge of celebrex and gabapentin at bedtime now. It's not a plurality, but of the remaining \"seronegative\" ones, there's a sizeable effect.\n\nThis is all with no actual passing-criteria ACR-approved diagnosis (maybe UCTD), which I feel like my attendings would have crucified me for, but technically many of them would have met the old 2012 EULAR classification that included ANA/RF as criteria. Several probably would have been given a seroneg RA diagnosis in the past.\n\nSummarizing some recent research:\n\n* 1/3 of Patients diagnosed w/ Sjogren's by lip biopsy didn't test positive for SSA/B; I imagine the seronegative patients were pretty dedicated to undergo a biopsy so could the prevalence be higher?\n* Sjogren's is thought to have a genetic predisposition w/ a viral trigger thought to be most common, though usually EBV is the most commonly blamed virus\n* Prevalence of Sjogren's is actually higher than RA, especially as women age, though since SS-A doesn't always trigger an ANA it's not usually caught serologically; it also is a surprisingly common comorbidity of dysautonomias and small-fiber neuropathy and Hashimoto's in studies of those conditions\n* COVID (and to an extent the Moderna vaccine w/ a higher mRNA load) has been shown to trigger some autoimmune conditions like psoriasis, dermatomyositis, etc., reported at ACR w/ good studies. Some other recent studies show similar antibody profiles or a Sjogren\u2019s-like syndrome on biopsy pathology. \n* Fibromyalgia is being investigated as a small fiber neuropathy in a subset of patients; and long COVID is showing high similarity to fibromyalgia overall though maybe some distinct differences, kinda like MIS-C and Kawasaki in kids.\n\nI guess I'm wondering, do I need a course correct? Am I seeing a pattern where there is none, using too non-specific tests and drawing conclusions from too small of a pool with a nonspecific jumbled mess of symptoms? Am I unknowingly treating simple seronegative RA w/ secondary sjogren's who just happened to have all had COVID like a good chunk of America? Are there more nonspecific UCTD arthritis patients out there than I was lead to believe in academia? Is hydroxychloroquine really just magic or one of the best placebos around? Am I just finding a cluster of synchronous weird cases? Is anyone else seeing similar?\n\nI'd love some thoughts, because I just don't want to be one of those docs that starts overcalling a pet theory. We all know the type. And I don't want to repeat the apparently controversial neuro-Sjogren's issues of the 80s/90s that my attendings told me about.",

In most cases, would you treat someone differently if they were seronegative and had a positive lip biopsy versus one that did not, if classic symptoms or an inflammatory arthritis was present? Convince me otherwise but my answer is no - if it quacks like a duck, I treat it like a duck instead of subjecting folks to lip biopsies just so I could say \"ok it's for sure Sjogrens now\" instead of \"we're probably looking at Sjogrens - let's try and get you feeling better\". On top of that, finding ENT to do lip biopsy, and a local path to do it, is tricky in private practice OR even in an academic institution where path is less familiar with these.\n\n\nI've adopted a more middle approach for Sjogren's. Clearly, if symptomatic, hydroxychloroquine. I do not shy away from prednisone in low doses for trial purposes but I will almost invariably transition to DMARD if this is helpful. If it is suspicious and seronegative, I explain the diagnostic criteria to the patient and give them the informed explanation and consent for lip biopsy followed by the recommendation that I don't necessarily recommend it unless they are dead set on having that piece of information. I explain I'm going to treat them regardless and give them counseling for artificial tears, saliva substitutes, etc, and after that I've only had one or two takers who want to proceed with biopsy. I also explained that the data seems to suggest a higher risk of lymphoma in folks who have positive lip biopsy, but I monitor these folks with annual labs anyway incl LDH, C4/RF (cryos if those are abml), SPEP/UPEP, UA, CBC, and explain that we watch for these downstream manifestations regardless. \n\n\nAs far as the low positive ANA and RFs, if it sounds like Sjogrens, then certainly explore that direction. What we don't see in our fellowship training is the more bread and butter community cases (at least not in the volume that we typically do once we become attendings). There are simply a ton of low titer ANA and rheumatoid factors out there that are not necessarily associated with any autoimmune disease. These folks deserve a good once-over, occasionally can be followed, and in more symptomatic cases, they may benefit from a trial of a DMARD. The actual diagnosis in name matters little, imo, particularly if you're achieving benefit in improving symptoms. There's a discussion here to be had about whether or not we're getting a placebo effect or not, but that's a discussion on it's own. When we're dealing with DMARDs that are benign in the grand scheme, like HCQ, the risk of trying someone out is minimal.\n\n\nWhat you said about your attendings crucifying you for not making an ACR - approved diagnosis, that resonated with me. I'm careful also not to go far off track here, but in my opinion academia lives in a bubble isolated from the real world. The guidelines help for the major diseases, sure, but there is so much more out there that we don't fully understand, that we don't have the tools and assays to detect, and/or will not land into a nice diagnostic bucket. This is probably true of most medical specialties but particularly true for ours. We live in the gray area (it's why other specialists look at us like the ANA wizards we are). We do not have a label for everything out there. I focus on treating symptoms at the end of the day and I'm not at all shy, nor would I suggest you be, to have a diagnosis in your chart of something like UCTD or \"inflammatory arthralgia NOS\" or whatever the case is.",

There was a correlation between severity of infection and age of infection with rates of asthma as well. \n\nAlthough it\u2019s an observational study and cannot prove causality, it seems more likely than correlative given that they used infection in general with RSV as the exposure rather than phenotypic RSV bronchiolitis. \n\nAdditionally, there\u2019s the evidence that being born at a different time of year can increase asthma risk (again timing of infection could be a reason): https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-56749154074&origin=inward&txGid=8e7089d536c8b917abf788b98334f322\n\nThis is very interesting to me in light of the new RSV mAb: Nirsevimab, which is indicated for all infants under 8 months of age.

        "text": "TLDR; these things sound new and exciting but no orthopedic surgeon is going to sacrifice their surgical outcome for the chance of a small reduction in symptomatic implants. \n\nI think what you want to nail down on is the \u201cwhy\u201d. Everyone loves this idea of \u201cabsorbable implants\u201d but at the end of the day does it really matter that much? I didn\u2019t read the full article but in the blurb they are concerned about airport security (so they wand you and add maybe 2 minutes to your process) and medical imaging. With imaging though it really only affects it if you\u2019re imaging something very close by because of the scatter and honesty the imaging tech is getting really good at removing that scatter. If you\u2019re needing a very high quality MRI or CT of an extremity that already has orthopedic implants in it then odds are the surgery to take those implants out is the least of your problems. \nPainful implants is certainly an argument but honestly that\u2019s relatively rare for a majority of injury types and a pretty simple procedure if it is an issue. \n\nThe downside to this is that there\u2019s no way you are going to get the same consistent material properties out of something that had been designed to break down vs something designed to be permanent. With that in mind what do you sacrifice for this, decreased ability to bear weight? Decreased ability to hold a reduction? The whole purpose of these orthopedic surgeries is to maintain alignment and restore function but a dissolving implant compromises your ability to do either. \n\nThis also doesn\u2019t take into account the new problem of the body reacting to these dissolving materials. Steel and titanium alloys are overall pretty inert but anything that\u2019s intended to be degraded by the body is going to set up an inflammatory or immune response. Just because you might not be able to see the implant on X-rays in 10 years doesn\u2019t mean that the body hasn\u2019t created a massive scar ball in its place that could be just as painful or could compromise future intervention in the area. Is this implant going to dissolve in a way that allows bone to fill in the defects or is it going to create some fibrinous sludge in its place so that now you have no implants AND non-healing holes in the bone creating stress risers so that you can get a new fracture down the line.",

I'm on a team that built an AI for medical use (we call it Olly), and it forces the LLM to reply based on medical guidelines. Turns out it is quite good at retrieving information to answer questions that come up at the point-of-care, like \"How do I diagnose a STEMI in the setting of LBBB?\".  We call this AI Olly and I've been using it for the past month or so. I truly think it helps me provide better care because it's so much faster for me to look up  things in the guidelines that more of my decisions are better informed.   \nFor anyone curious about what we've built, you can also use Olly (go to\u00a0https://olly.health/).

It is indicated for 72 hours post-coitus or as soon as possible but may still be effective 120 hours post-coitus or potentially longer. They do not cause a fertilized egg, after endometrial implantation, to be ejected from the endometrium. \n\nWhat they do is inhibit or delay ovulation, and possibly some additional effects on the sperm itself. No egg, at least for the period for sperm to die, means no fertilization and then no pregnancy. That\u2019s not an abortion in the conventional or technical sense of the word, any more than intercourse insufficiently close to ovulation is an abortion.\n\nI don\u2019t know what your list of pdfs is supposed to be, and without a link I can\u2019t read them. However, I think it\u2019s unlikely in the extreme that they contain earth-shattering evidence that contradicts expert consensus.\n\nEdit: you may read elsewhere that levonorgestrel (plan b) affects the endometrium to prevent implantation post-fertilization.

    "text": "See the American Hospital Association's [18 pages of drivel](https://www.regulations.gov/comment/FTC-2023-0007-8138) (aka tag: long and wrong) in response to the FTC's proposed ban on non-competes.\n\nSome low-lights:\n\n* Page 2: \"At the very least, any rule that the FTC finalizes must specifically exempt physicians and senior hospital executives or, more generally, highly-skilled, highly-compensated employees...\"\n* Page 4: Argues that the FTC cannot retroactively ban existing non-competes, arguing that \"employers have *already* performed their duty under the contract by hiring the employee; the employee, by contrast, still has not completed her duty to abide by the non-compete agreement.\" In other words, the employer fulfills their contractual duty at the moment of hiring, whereas the employee's duties exist in essential perpetuity until the employer decides otherwise.\n* Page 6 discusses existing regulations on non-competes. Notice how the earlier paragraphs mention physicians and senior level executives, but henceforth they seem to be focusing only on physicians. Why is that?\n* Page 7: \"the weight of the existing research indicates that non-compete agreements for certain categories of employees are beneficial \u2013 namely, doctors and senior hospital executives. This is exactly the experience of the AHA\u2019s member hospitals and health systems. \" Bullshit meter rising..\n* Page 8: Cites some pretty weak evidence from an Ohio State researcher which I'll discuss in a separate post.\n* Page 10-11: \"*First*, non-compete agreements are valuable tools for protecting investments that hospitals make to recruit doctors and senior executives.\" Discusses how difficulty recruiting patients in rural areas limits access to care-- neglecting the fact that doctors may not want to work in a hospital with a noncompete, thereby restricting the available recruiting pool. Weakass argument.\n* Page 12: \"*Second*, non-compete agreements encourage hospitals and health systems to make investments in training their employees. While much of a physician\u2019s training occurs in medical school and residency, doctors must stay current with scientific developments and innovation.\" So without non-competes, hospitals won't care if their doctors are up to date? That's a failing of the hospital, not of banning non-competes. Also cites a study that seems to be focused on executives, not physicians.\n* Page 13: \"*Third*, non-competes encourage the sharing of proprietary information within hospitals and health systems. \" What-the-what? Trying to make the argument that innovation is promoted by restricting access, which is anathema to public knowledge, which forms the basis of medicine.\n* Page 15: Ah, the crux of the argument. \"Doctors and executives are fundamentally different from other workers that have received the most attention from the FTC... the FTC\u2019s core concerns of genuinely unequal bargaining power at the time of hiring or exit do not apply.\"",

    "title": "New Study Shows Aircraft Wastewater Surveillance Can Monitor SARS-CoV-2 Variants",
    "text": "*A recent study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and biotech company Ginkgo Bioworks found that wastewater from aircrafts could be an effective tool for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 variants. The research showed that this testing could be done cheaply and easily, without disturbing passengers or airport operations.*\n\nA new study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and biotech company Ginkgo Bioworks has shown that aircraft wastewater surveillance can be a useful and low-resource approach to monitoring SARS-CoV-2 variants. The study found that the testing was easy and could be done cheaply, only adding about three extra minutes to aircraft maintenance times at airports. The authors of the study say that this approach could provide a complementary early warning system for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants and other pathogens of public health concern.\n\n## The Study\n\nThe study was conducted in collaboration with Ginkgo Bioworks and tested wastewater samples from 80 international flights into New York City's John F. Kennedy International Airport between August 1 and September 9, 2022. All flights originated from the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and France. The researchers collected and tested 65 airborne sewage samples, and 81 percent of the samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The rate of positive samples was the same among the three countries. The researchers were also able to get 27 genome sequences from 25 of the samples. All of the genomes revealed omicron sublineages, mostly BA.5 as well as BA.4.6 and BA.2.75.\n\n## The Feasibility\n\nThe study demonstrated the feasibility of aircraft wastewater surveillance as a low-resource approach compared with individual testing to monitor SARS-CoV-2 variants without direct traveler involvement or disruption to airport operations. According to the authors, the testing only added about three extra minutes to aircraft maintenance times at airports and didn't require hassling passengers with nose swabs or other sampling methods. The authors concluded that the testing could be easily scaled up as needed as the world largely abandons other SARS-CoV-2 testing and monitoring strategies.\n\n## The Importance\n\nThe study adds to other evidence that airport and aircraft wastewater surveillance can play a role in monitoring the spread of pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2. This method has already been used in various places around the country for monitoring early surges of COVID-19 as well as tracking the spread of polio in New York. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, viral shedding in feces can begin very early in an infection, potentially before a person has symptoms.\n\n## Limitations\n\nWhile the study has shown the effectiveness of aircraft wastewater surveillance, there are limitations to this method. It will be mostly helpful for longer flights, where people are more likely to use the lavatory. Additionally, it's unclear if all airlines will agree to the sampling. Lastly, because international travelers can have various connecting flights before arriving in the US, it might not be possible to track the origin of variants that arrive in the US.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe study conducted by the CDC and Ginkgo Bioworks has demonstrated that aircraft wastewater surveillance can be an effective and low-resource approach to monitoring SARS-CoV-2 variants. The authors say that this approach could provide a complementary early warning system for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants and other pathogens of public health concern.",

    "text": "Note- I\u2019m a nurse and work night shift so I almost never get the chance to talk to the primary doctors or advocate for palliative consults. \n\nI\u2019ve had so many patients where it seems blatantly obvious that they are going to either die or have a very poor outcome, or that treatment would cause extreme suffering, but palliative care is never consulted. I\u2019m trying to understand what\u2019s going on with the mindset and culture of some doctors who either refuse to consult palliative care or put it off essentially until the patient is actively dying. These are not cases  where the patient/family refuse palliative care, but where it has not been offered.\n\nIt\u2019s also been brought to my attention that I\u2019m equating palliative care with goals of care conversations, which I know is incorrect. But that\u2019s the culture at my hospital-I\u2019ve never heard of IM or any specialty (besides critical care) having the kind of meeting where all the family and decisions makers sit down and talk out all the prognosis, treatment options, etc. It seems to exclusively be done by our palliative care service. \n\nfew examples-\n\nPatient in his 70s came in with hip fracture. Turns out the fracture was pathological from bone mets of some cancer (this was years ago so I forget which kind). He was started on chemo but it caused kidney injury which was not recovering and he was on the edge of starting dialysis, and thus further cancer treatment had been deferred. He was also in so much pain from the fracture that he had been bed bound for weeks. He and his wife expressed extreme frustration with not understanding what was happening or why, not having his pain controlled, and not having a coherent plan between IM, nephro, and onc. I suggested that they insist on a palliative consult because it was clear none of the doctors were going to do it.\n\nA 74 year old came in with hip fracture. He had severe COPD and heart failure and had lost about 50 pounds unintentionally in the last year. POD 2 from the hip surgery he develops shortness of breath and chest pain. He\u2019s super tachycardic and tachypneic with increased oxygen demand. Troponin was elevated, BNP was elevated, WBC were elevated, and fecal hemoccult was positive. He gets put on Abx for possible sepsis, and heparin drip for NSTEMI. He looks like shit and you can hear his lung sounds from out in the hallway. Cardiology is consulted and is very clear about his poor prognosis and at least gets him changed to DNR. His day nurse asked his IM hospitalist about a palliative consult and was told \u201che doesn\u2019t have a terminal condition.\u201d  Which 1- isn\u2019t true, and 2- is a gross misunderstanding of palliative care\n\nAn 88 year old man came in with chest pain and is found to have a large mediastinal mass causing SVC syndrome. He\u2019s started on chemo and radiation. He becomes bedbound and neutropenic/pancytopenic and is barely eating. The night I had him he developed fever, hypotension, and new confusion so we got a sepsis work up and started Abx. His day hospitalist actually came around before my shift ended so I asked her about a palliative consult and was told it wasn\u2019t needed because he\u2019s \u201ca healthy 88\u201d but also because his family are church friends with the oncologist.\n\nI\u2019ve been thinking about what my personal criteria for consulting palliative would be, if I had that power. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve come up with:\n\nAny hospitalization of any patient over 90 years old\n\nAny patient whose been hospitalized 3 or more times in a year for the same/related conditions\n\nAny new diagnosis of a progressive or life changing chronic disease like cancer, heart failure, COPD, dementia, end stage renal failure, neurodegenerative diseases, etc\n\nEdit- on further thought I\u2019m adding to the list- any ICU stay of over 7 days\n\nSo, when do you consult palliative care? What insight do you have into doctors who are hesitant to consult?\n",

        "text": "I am a palliative care doctor working in Australia. We get a lot of poor quality consults for many reasons: reluctance to get pall care in early enough, poor understanding of what palliative care involves, services varying between locations, people not realising you can both be on treatment and have pall care at the same time, not actually having a question beyond \"the patient has cancer\". Like every other specialty, you will get better results from your pall care team if there's a clear question for the consult.\n\nThe most common reasons to consult pall care:\n\n* Complex symptom management: difficult to control pain, nausea, secretions, dyspnoea, bowel obstructions etc - all your patients would benefit from pall care involvement to help them with symptoms even if they are undergoing treatment.\n* End of life care, especially transitioning to end of life at home\n* Difficult goals of care conversations\n* Transitioning home for community support, particularly if the palliative care team has a strong multidisciplinary presence in the community\n\nThe 90 year old patient doesn't have specialist palliative care needs just due to their age. Any doctor should be able to have a goals of care discussion with them.\n\nWith regard to chronic diseases, the model varies depending on the health system. This is because these patients may live for years, and therefore they require different resource models. Some places have embedded supportive care, of which the most developed is renal supportive care. RSC will usually see patients with eGFR <30 with symptoms, all patients eGFR <15, patients on dialysis and transplant patients. There are developing services in Australia for cardiac, respiratory and neuro supportive care.\n\nThe question of timing is a difficult one in palliative care. It's difficult to identify the patients who have the most need for it. It often feels like there is endless need, but we are also a limited resource. We cannot see every heart failure/COPD/dementia at diagnosis, and really we shouldn't need to. Many of these patients would greatly benefit from their usual doctors having more experience and the time to deliver generalist palliative care, including goals of care discussions and simple end of life care.\n\nPalliative care is highly location-dependent, though, so always speak with your local service to see what they offer!",

The threshold for me to consult palliative care is stupid low at my hospital because our palliative care team is amazing. I basically get them on for anybody with multiple conditions causing them discomfort, young or old. They have a team that can follow as outpatient so I get them on inpatient to connect with the patient and help them as outpatient too.\u00a0\n\nThat being said, that can vary. I used to work at a hospital where one of the palliative care docs could manage to get a patient full code and piss off a family all at once when I already had talked to them and made them a do not resuscitate and so consulting them would make a lot more work for me. I also don\u2019t consult them if I\u2019ve broached the subject with the family and the patient and they\u2019re adamant they don\u2019t want to talk to that team even after I\u2019ve explained their condition to them. Other doctors prefer to have those conversations themselves and not involve a palliative care team because they\u2019re comfortable having those conversations themselves. \u00a0There\u2019s lots of reasons that somebody might logistically not want palliative care on a case\u2014that said me personally, anytime I see somebody struggling I call them because I know that I can rely on my palliative care doc and his nurse practitioner 100% to help my patient, be it in the hospital or outpatient.\u00a0\n\nYour criteria are pretty much when I do consult people with the exception of age because age just doesn\u2019t have as much to do with it for me. If somebody is 90 years old and just there because they had a heart cath and are being monitored overnight but are doing well overall, (and have good family support/social support and aren\u2019t really struggling with any major medical conditions) getting inpatient palliative care to talk to them isn\u2019t going to be helpful\u2014 there isn\u2019t anything to necessarily to palliate there. (I always lock down a code status on those people even if they\u2019re just there overnight so I generally have a good feeling on where they\u2019re at with things based on that convo.)\n\nI personally would absolutely get on palliative care for those patients that you mentioned but I think part of that is going to be based on what kind of palliative care team is available at your hospital. \u00a0The reasons that those Hospitalists gave are certainly not reasons to not get on palliative care, and I don\u2019t think they have a great understanding of palliative care based on those reasons but potentially it could be something else like the palliative care team rejecting consults or making messes of situations that the hospitalist feels that they\u2019re handling well enough on their own during the day. Not saying that\u2019s it but just that there may be more moving pieces than just misunderstanding palliative care\u2019s whole deal on their parts.\u00a0\n\nJust some perspective from a hospitalist (who is probably going to go do a fellowship in palliative care herself one of these days, ha.)",

I love it, and I'm so passionate about it I formally help teach other clinicians about communication with families.  I am not a palliative care provider, and I am aware they do a huge scope of wonderful things (thank you pal docs!!); but it seems your post is expressing more frustration with lack of clear direction regarding goals of care rather than palliation; forgive me if I'm misinterpreting.  I will reply as if your frustration is more about goals of care rather than palliation of symptoms. \n\nI have a couple of points I'd like to gently address in your post.  \n\n1) You are night shift and say you don't interact with the doctors much.  Are you certain that \"none of the doctors\" are doing goals of care discussions themselves? Perhaps its not well documented but these conversations are happening out of your line of sight, and the families are insistent upon aggressive life-prolonging measures.  Heck, sometimes even the patients themselves are insistent on things that are...essentially unreasonable.  We operate in a system (assuming you are in US) in which we are (?unfortunately...up for further discussion) beholden to the wishes of the family. \n\n2) If someone's family is church friends with the oncologist, yes I agree there might be hesitancy to address goals of care; but on the other than there may be surprising opportunities for goals of care to have been addressed with a culture context.  our service once trach'd and PEG'd a young woman with a brainstem hemorrhage, then upon transfer out of the unit she was accepted by a hospitalist in their church.  the hospitalist was able to connect with them on a level I was not - and they transitioned to comfort measures only/hospice measures.\n\n3) I ABSOLUTELY agree, that you have a great list of patients at the bottom of your note in which goals of care and symptom management should be aggressively addressed.  I was involved in a quality improvement process that implemented a checklist of patients who should have a \"family meeting\" and the criteria are nearly identical.\n\nI imagine you are facing a great deal of moral distress in your role, watching these patients suffer.  I feel a great deal of moral distress in my role as well and I hope you are able to find some relief from that.",

Talking about \"let's get palliative care\" as being equivalent to \"someone should talk about this\" isn't good medical care and it's not good use of palliative care doctors. The above examples seem to imply a failure of advance care planning before and during the admission. In that case, the primary teams should do better. If they did goals of care and this is, sincerely, what's right for patients based on their wishes, then it's unfortunate but it's more nuanced than \"consult palliative care.\"\n\nMy bar for involving palliative care is usually if there's some kind of big complexity and it requires a specialist opinion, eg, prognosticating a dementia syndrome I see rarely, figuring out hospice logistics for someone marginally housed, or continuity for someone who's going to be frequently admitted and slowly dying who'd benefit from having one consistent palliative person present.",

Just like managing straight forward CHF, AKI, cellulitis, etc does not require a consult to those specialties, managing goals of care, pain control, end of life, does not require a palliative care specialist. In fact there is nothing in particular that a palliative care specialist can do that a hospitalist can't.\n\nSo, just like with other specialties, I consult palliative when things are complex and I want a specialist managing a difficult situation. If things are straight forward, there is no need to consult palliative.\n\nHere's an example: elderly lady with lung cancer admitted in full respiratory failure. After a few days on bipap she had not improved. Daughter is at the bedside and is the POA. We discuss at the bedside that mom wouldn't want to be like this. Still at the bedside, she calls her sibling so I can explain the situation, and they both agree to withdraw care. I set up a time later that day to remove bipap and start comfort measures. I do that. Pt dies that night. Palliative was never involved because they didn't need to be. \n\nVs this different example: POA and brother get in a shouting match in the hallways because they disagree over removing care. The POA can't find the POA paperwork but swears mom said it should be her. There is another kid who lives in Timbuktu and they don't want to let Mom die until everyone is together but he can't get off work for another week. Then the POA demands we can do an elective PEG tube first so Mom isn't hungry when she dies. Now I'm calling palliative because this situation has gotten way out of hand",

I think back to my training about allergic contact dermatitis to polyacrylamide, but that would occur a few days to weeks after the injection. I Google \"Aquafilling Covid Reaction\" on the computer. The patient scowls. The first hit is \"Foreign body reaction to polyacrylamide filler (Aquafilling\u00ae) injected nine years previously\". Got to love Google.\n\nI put on gloves and examine her more closely, now appreciating about a dozen superficial and deep rock hard nodules around her mouth. They are apparently tender because she winces slightly on palpation, but says nothing.\n\n\"Sometimes when the immune system is very active, such as fighting a virus, it can start attacking things that it shouldn't. We call that a foreign body reaction. Unfortunately, polyacrylamide is a permanent filler so we can't just dissolve it, so I think the best course of action is to trying to inject cortisone and reduce the inflammation\"\n\nI finish my exam and throw away the gloves.\n\n\"You are the doctor. I'll do what you say. How much you charge? One thousand? Two thousand?\" She says adjusting the hijab.\n\n\"No ma'am, it's a medical procedure so I would bill your insurance. But its much less than that\"\n\nHer body language softens and she smiles slightly. \"Mashallah, I can tell you are good doctor\"\n\nI relish in her gratitude for a moment.

FDA has approved more than 50 of these safe and effective treatment options for a variety of diseases and conditions including diabetes, some cancers, arthritis, macular degeneration, and more.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nBiosimilars are expanding into new clinical areas and previously approved biosimilars that were not yet marketed are now available, increasing opportunities for prescribers and patients to encounter them. We want to know what questions you have.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI will be answering questions about biosimilar and interchangeable products, the development and approval process for these products, pharmacy-level substitution, and more, starting at 2:30 p.m. ET on Thursday, June 6, 2024.

    "title": "MRI Tech here - please help me understand \"the neuro exam\" and other questions/concerns",
    "text": "Hello meddit, \n\nI'm an MRI tech and one of the big challenges we face are patients who need *something* to help them successfully complete their MRI exam, but for several possible reasons the medications are just not ordered. As you are aware, a lot of the times patients are ordered for various brain/neuro MRIs due to AMS, dementia, strokes, tumors (pre and post op, of course) and anything else that may be explained by some jostling to the structural integrity of the brain meat. My general complaint here also extends to patients when other body parts are ordered for MRI but neuro reasons among others (ie, in the case of pediatric patients - parents not wanting their kids to get medications or not thinking they will need it) also prevent appropriate-for-completing-an-MRI medications from being ordered along with the MRI exam. \n\nA huge frustration myself and my coworkers experience basically daily is when doctors or APPs who order these exams don't want to order some kind of anxiolytic, pain medicine, sedative, etc because it \"may obscure the neuro exam\". I tried asking one of the neurosurgery fellows about this last time he was in our department, but he was there with a patient that was decompensating and it was not really a good time for him to educate me. I want to understand instead of just being angry and frustrated by this situation actively preventing me from doing my job. I also understand sometimes that the stability of the patient's vital signs make sedation medically ill-advised because we do generally like when our patients continue to breathe on their own, although the images would definitely not be motion degraded if they stopped that! (rimshot)\n\nFrom my non-physician, extremely focused as an MRI tech perspective, it seems like the options here are either a non-obscured neuro exam ***OR*** diagnostic MR images. The patients who generally need some pharmacological help for their MRIs are either altered, pediatric, claustrophobic, have involuntary motion, or don't have their pain sufficiently controlled for lying still on a hard MRI table for an extended period of time. I really don't remember having such an issue with getting patients medicated for their MRIs at my previous job compared to this one, so I'm not sure if it's just facility culture or what.  \n\nIs there some kind of reversible or short term medication or something that can keep a patient calm/still enough for them to get through an entire brain MRI (15-60 minutes, depending on protocol) while also not snowing them and preventing useful neuro exams for an extended period of time? What is the benefit of a garbage, motion degraded MRI and possibly traumatizing a patient vs losing out on some accurate assessments for a few hours? This is a sincere question, coming from a place of wanting to learn and understand because we do want to help you and successfully scan your patients! But most days it feels like we aren't on the same team.\n\nDo most physicians/non-radiology staff roles have a poor or limited understanding of what an MRI exam entails/requires of a patient in order to get useful imaging for the radiologist? I have had more than one doctor and nurse tell me their patient is perfectly calm/fine/okay to lie flat, but being in a hospital bed or stretcher with freedom of motion is a LOT different than lying actually flat on the MRI table and needing to stay as still as possible through all the noise and possibly with a head coil (\"cage\") over their face. I also take issue to the suggestion from more than a few doctors and nurses for us to just strap a patient down and force them to make an attempt. This has been suggested for pediatric and adult patients alike, and will actively traumatize a patient as well as likely cause compounding issues down the line as far as distrust in medical professionals and any instance where they may need another MRI or uncomfortable treatment later on.\n\nHow do I bridge the gap here and facilitate better understanding for myself/other MRI techs as well as the teams who seemingly don't care to try and understand things from our point of view?",

Axiolytics (namely benzos) are great for anxious/claustrophobic patients who are able to follow commands and just need some help staying calm in the scanner.\n\nPatients who cannot sit still and follow commands due to dementia, delirium, and other organic brain diseases are a different story. They don't need help calming down. They don't know what the f*** is going on, and when you tell them to stay still, they're either going to forget within 30 seconds or aren't registering at all. A milligram of lorazepam isn't going to fix that, if anything it makes delirious patients more delirious and disinhibited patients more disinhibited. The only way to get them to sit still is to sedate them to the point that they go into a deep sleep (affectionately known as \"snowing\"). *It's not safe to snow patients and then send them off to an unmonitored setting.* Why? Because I cannot possibly know what dose of lorazepam or haloperidol will reliably make grandpa stop squirming and go to sleep for an hour, but also definitely not make him obstruct his airway and vomit and aspirate in the scanner or holding area when nobody is looking. It's like Indiana Jones trying to guesstimate the right weight of sand that won't trigger the booby trap. It's reckless. If a patient needs moderate sedation for MRI, this needs to be done by anesthesia. Or we shouldn't bother trying to scan them at all. So many physicians and APPs don't understand this concept.",

        "text": "From a neurosurgery standpoint \n\nIt\u2019s not necessarily that we need a minute to minute exam on these patients. We leave them in scanner alone, after all. The problem is that we need them to stay awake and breathing so their problem doesn\u2019t get worse\n\nThis is mainly a problem when patients have increased intracranial pressure, or a tumor or something that could cause increased ICP but isn\u2019t yet. \n\nWhen patients lie flat, the intracranial pressure is increased. For someone with a tumor or hydrocephalus who is just barely ok, lying them flat for 45 minutes can push them off a cliff and they can have serious neurologic problems. \n\nThen, anxiolytic or narcotic medications cause people to be sleepy and breathe less. When you breathe less, your blood carbon dioxide level increases. This causes your intracranial pressure to increase. This causes you to become sleepier and breathe less, which increases your carbon dioxide level. Soon, you\u2019re not breathing and your intracranial pressure is sky high, and you\u2019re dead\n\nThis happens every so often. I have seen it many times. It is a serious situation to send someone with a bad brain problem down for MRI. \n\nYou probably also get the same spiel for patients to whom this doesn\u2019t truly apply but who fall under the \u201cbrain problem\u201d umbrella and someone said not to order Ativan. But this is where it comes from. \u201cObscuring the exam\u201d is often invoked in \u201cneuro patients\u201d but this not really the situation here.\n\nAs a neurosurgeon I will not budge if I insist that a certain patient not have sedating medications. But some of these problems can be treated before an MRI, like placing an EVD etc. \n\nIt\u2019s not all about the patient experience and the patient-physician-MRI tech relationship. When the problem is life threatening and I am the only one who can fix it, I\u2019m the boss. We can talk it out later, assuming the patient can still talk.",

There are a few occasional legitimate scenarios where it wouldn't be appropriate to order a sedative med for a patient having an MRI, for example concerns about respiratory status/airway, patients extremely sensitive or allergic to the meds etc., but like others have pointed out in this thread, a patients neurologic exam is not particularly important while they are in an MRI scanner, as 1) no one is examining them in there and we have short duration meds that wear off quickly and 2) the MRI findings are often as important as the serial exams. Most neurosurgeons aren't rushing to the OR with a normal MRI after all. \n\nAdditionally, if a patient is that critical that even the slightest sedation is contraindicated most likely we are looking for the big stuff like worsening hydrocephalus, hemorrhage etc. The extra tissue contrast of MRI isn't doing much (especially with a combative patient), so you could just get a CT or CTA and get the answer that much faster. OR just intubate them then get the MRI. This might be useful in something like a basilar artery occlusion for example.",

If not already tubed, then there were some where the potential complications of even a short lived benzo in a stroke patient outside of the acute event could cause real worsening leading to a need for ventilation where there was no need prior. \n\nIs it a specific complaint/patient population you notice this in?\n\nAlso, for pediatrics if it is an MRI due to confirmed seizures activity they may be concerned about interactions with other seizure medications already started which could lead to worsening neurological symptoms. \n\nI do agree that MRIs have need for the ability to be truly still as much as possible and that strapping people down is not conducive to establishing rapport with your patients. I don't have an easy answer for you though.

If I were worried about raised ICP I would be much more hesitant.

People are being encouraged to share this article with us https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/pfas/resources/pfas-information-for-clinicians.html\n\nWhile I think PFAS are an issue, I do not feel that guidance to test individual serum levels is appropriate at this time given there are no established serum levels that correlate to health risk and no known treatments to reduce serum levels. Isn\u2019t this just going to serve as a way to increase health anxiety. Isn\u2019t this why we didn\u2019t screen everyone for Hep C until we had effective and tolerable treatment options? Shouldn\u2019t the focus be on reducing PFAS in the supply chain vs tasking medicine with something there\u2019s no treatment yet for? \n\nI\u2019m seeing articles everywhere so it will only be a matter of time before we start to field requests for PFAS testing.

I realize there are DEA restrictions but from a purely efficacious standpoint would this be a less harmful option in routine usage?\n\n\n\n*edit: Thank you everyone for the discussion. Here are my takeaways:\n\n1) Buprenorphine is a potentially valuable and underused therapy in a chronic pain regimen and may have a higher safety profile than full opioid agonists, though it may be inadequate in the management of acute pain. However, its high affinity and long duration of action could negatively impact the action of naloxone as an antidote.\n\n2) Despite popular belief, the naloxone added to Suboxone is of dubious effect in the prevention of misuse. One paper variously describes it as \"inert\", its effects \"mild at best\", and its deterring effect as an ethically unsound placebo.\n\n3) Current literature regarding pain management is inadequate.\n\n4) Personality and tradition remain strong factors in regard to changing standards of practice.",

But Butrans is cheap and I def prefer it over any full opiate agonist in the treatment of subacute or chronic pain. But as we all know, opiates for chronic pain in the first place are dumb.",

My pain dr put me on 75 mcg fentanyl patches with oxycodone for breakthrough pain. I continued with this therapy for 14 years. For the most part, my pain was well controlled. Until year 12 when it wasn\u2019t. It\u2019s like the opioids turned on me. My pain was through the roof (to the point of vomiting at least once a day due to pain) and this of course raised my anxiety. I was working 45 hours a week in hospice and I suddenly could no longer work. . I told my dr this for 2 years but he never changed anything. Then Covid hit and I had to go back to work becuz my husband lost his roofing business when construction was shut down. I had to research this myself and (I may have got it wrong) but I believe I was suffering from hyper analgesia. I knew I had to get off the opiates but I couldn\u2019t deal with months of withdrawals. In 2022 I called a suboxone dr and within a week (after stabilizing) I felt better than I had in years. My pain is now controlled well with pregabalin, suboxone and occasionally a combination Advil and Tylenol ( best invention in years imo). So, do opiates work for chronic pain? They do until they don\u2019t! If anyone listened to my little rant, it\u2019s much appreciated!",

I'm a gyn oncologist and i'm on call this Christmas weekend again. I actually purposely choose it because I don't have any kids so I try to let those with kids spend it together. Unfortunately, cancer doesn't take a break on the holidays. Friday I had to tell someone that her tumor doubled in size in such a short time frame that we have no options left; she opted for no treatment and to go on hospice. Today, one of our patients presents to the ED septic with a bowel perf. Unfortunately, she is not the best surgical patient either and is now opting for comfort measures only. After having to have this conversation, I return to the computers to document and take a breather. And guess what song is playing from the nurses' station? Last Christmas. That's when it dawned on me. For my patients, this is literally their Last Christmas.\n\nWhy am I posting this? I guess a place to vent. This is my own form of therapy in a way. In a weird way, hearing that song at that time opened my eyes. Working on Christmas sucks, but at least I know that my day isn't as bad as my patients'. Anyways, enough sad stuff. I hope meddit has a happy holidays! From all roles and levels of training, and your patients appreciate ALL that you do. Work is hard, but you're doing some good.",

However, with a busy practice and the volume of patients an average physician sees, the uncommon becomes common. For suspected infections usually associated with staph aureus pending or without microbiological results, many patients do respond to cephalosporins, but some won\u2019t and we add vancomycin. For patients with diagnoses with established literature where TCAs have been shown to be effective or patient has tried many SSRIs/SNRIs/atypical agents, sure let\u2019s try a TCA. Both staph aureus and these psychosomatic diagnoses are so common, your typical physician will have enough of the \u201coutliers\u201d from textbook cases that our years of education and experience allows us to judiciously practice the art of medicine. \n\nMy last sentence is why practicing medicine can be challenging but fun and interesting! Part of the reason why this is all worth it\u2026now let me recover before I have to go back to the office tomorrow to my stack of paperwork, inbox results, and patient messages.",

Onc attending messages me back - \"yeah, this lady is definitely not making it out of here. If we can come we'll come, but if not let your team know hospice is reasonable.\"   Cool. Fast forward to the actual meeting. Oncology enters. Same guy who just told me this lady is dying looks the family directly in the eyes and tells them he has \"some pretty good chemo options if she can make it to the outpatient clinic.\" Who would withdraw after news like that? Why not say hey she's maxed on the vent, CRRT, 3 pressors and is septic and fungemic. Maybe getting to clinic is a pipe dream.\n\nOut in the hall I said hey, didn't you just tell me earlier this lady wasn't making it to clinic? Him - \"well we can't ever say there's zero chance. And the family clearly wants aggressive treatment\"\n\n Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyy?!  This is a daily occurrence.

The infants would be on high-frequency oscillating ventilators, multiple pressors, in chronic renal failure with brain bleeds and my attending would say to the parents (who didn't speak English and didn't even have a 5th grade education) that, \"he has some difficulties ahead.\"\n\nAnd so because of this, I was required to *medically torture* helpless infants *until they died some nine months later.*  I should have documented what was happening so I could go to authorities after I graduated and get the place shut down, but I didn't know.  I thought, being a clueless resident, that we were following standard of care.\n\nI finally put my foot down when one attending said he was going to try to resuscitate a Potter's Sequence baby due to be born to a 15-yo monolingual non-English-speaking mother.  I knew she hadn't the foggiest idea what was *actually* going to happen and so I told the attending: \"I respect you, but if this infant is born while I am on service, I am not participating in any resuscitation of that infant unless they cry.  If you feel it necessary to discuss my position with senior department leadership, I'll be happy to attend that meeting.\"\n\nTo his credit, he did respect my position.  I did not have to go before department leadership.  The infant was born after I was off service and died in the DR after aggressive resuscitation attempts.\n\nTo the infants who I tortured, but also to the memory of Hippocrates the Healer, I hope you can forgive me, for I knew not what I did.\n\nTo my colleagues, *please* learn how to have these conversations.

    "text": "tL;dr Patient died of an aneurysm in ED waiting room at UF Health Shands Hospital.\n\nOn March 11, 2024, UF Health Shands Hospital (UF Health), Gainesville, Florida, entered into a $119,942 settlement agreement with OIG. The settlement agreement resolves allegations that UF Health violated the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA). Based on its investigation, OIG concluded that on August 30, 2021, UF Health violated the requirements of EMTALA when it failed to evaluate and stabilize a patient who was in UF Health\u2019s waiting room for approximately 16 hours. The patient presented to UF Health\u2019s Emergency Department (ED) at 10:13 a.m. with complaints of throat swelling and difficulty eating and swallowing. UF Health provided the patient with an initial screening examination at 11:03 a.m. via a Zoom telehealth, less than an hour after arrival. The initial screening exam included orders for labs, an x-ray, and a CT scan. The CT scan was resulted at 6:38 p.m. while the patient was in the ED waiting room. The patient was not discharged following the CT scan, and his care was not handed over to the next shift of ED health care providers. At 7:22 p.m. the patient requested evaluation of a new complaint, chest pain accompanied by a warm sensation. Other than taking a blood pressure measurement at 7:34 p.m., UF Health failed to evaluate the patient\u2019s chest pain to determine whether he had an emergency medical condition and failed to provide stabilizing treatment. The patient was found unresponsive in the ED waiting room at 2:01 a.m. on August 31, 2021. ED staff were unable to resuscitate him. Autopsy results showed that he died of a ruptured aneurysm. Senior Counsel Julie Redlinger represented OIG.",

They are ordering this lab on what seems to be every new patient, regardless of age, cardiac risk, family cardiac history, prior to any cholesterol labs, etc. Of course, some of these are coming back extremely elevated leading the patients to panic and the PCP to go on a wild goose chase trying to figure out why their levels are so high. I\u2019m seeing numerous additional labs ordered, and referrals to either rheumatology or cardiology due to this one lab being abnormal. What are thoughts on this and when are you initiating statins because of it? Does a patient need a cardiac calcium scan to rule out cardiac/vascular disease in light of this one lab even with normal cholesterol levels? Or are we telling them diet and exercise are first line treatment and not investigating the cause of the elevated levels but rechecking in a few months? This lab has become quite annoying and worrisome for many patients and answers are difficult to find. I\u2019m not even sure why these doctors are ordering it in the first place with no other blatant risk factors, or even with blatant risk factors as it doesn\u2019t really tell us much expect for elevated cardiac event risk, so curious to hear others opinions on this and if I\u2019m missing something here as a surgical PA .

CRP has existed for a while but had a low bound where the assay did not accurately report values less than 3 (IIRC). \n\nSo in the process to help risk stratification hsCRP was developed to see this low level of chronic inflammation. Like all tests it needs context. It is not an \"all-comer\" test. There really isn't an intervention to address hsCRP itself.\n\n**Primary Prevention:**The American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF) and the American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines recommend hs-CRP measurement in intermediate-risk patients to guide further evaluation and therapy in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (Class IIa recommendation). The JUPITER trial demonstrated that statin therapy in patients with elevated hs-CRP (>2 mg/L) and low LDL-C significantly reduced the incidence of first major cardiovascular events.\n\n**Secondary Prevention:**In patients with known coronary artery disease, hs-CRP has been shown to predict recurrent events.\u00a0Elevated hs-CRP levels are associated with higher mortality and poorer prognosis in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Additionally, hs-CRP levels measured at the time of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) can predict long-term outcomes, including mortality and myocardial infarction.\n\n**Clinical Utility:**The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the AHA recommend hs-CRP measurement as an adjunct to the Framingham risk score to identify patients who may benefit from more aggressive risk-reduction strategies.",

And the specialist is unaware.\n\nAfter a few disastrous delays on getting sicker patients in faster, I've gotten into the habit of doing my own triage by looking ahead on my schedule (or if referring doc calls in a severe issue which I'd highly prefer), and then I bump those higher priority cases forward by \"overbooking\" into time that I've set aside for that purpose.\n\nSO for cases like this, I'd strongly advise a provider-to-specialist physician direct phone call on higher priority patients with higher M&M risk to discuss, that might bump them forward on the specialist physician's schedule.",

    "text": "Lately I've had occasional difficulties with pharmacies denying my prescriptions based on diagnosis. I know this is becoming a thing, but in some cases it's getting out of hand. Instead of huffing and puffing, I want to know if this is normal and what's going on behind the scenes.\n\nI saw a patient with stromal herpetic keratitis - herpes infection of cornea causing corneal inflammation. Appropriate treatment involves topical steroids, so I prescribed them.\n\nThe patient called shortly after to say the pharmacy had refused to fill the prescription. The pharmacist told me it was because his computer system flagged herpetic keratitis as an infection and topical steroids as therefore contraindicated. He gave me a small bit of pushback but agreed to dispense when I said the Rx was correct.\n\nWhile it's true that topical steroids should not be used in *some* forms of herpetic keratitis, it's absolutely the right treatment for other forms, and I've prescribed it countless times before without pharmacy issues.\n\nThe behavior seems inconsistent to me. If the pharmacy is so concerned about inappropriate use of eye drops, it's inconsistent to let primary care physicians and even mid-levels hand out Maxitrol like candy, or prescribe topical antibiotics for a dx of pink eye.\n\nMost frustrating was that they sent the patient home without notifying me in any way. A phone call would have been great, or at least an e-message, so we could have solved it right there instead of forcing the patient to make another trip back to the pharmacy. Meanwhile, I get pharmacies calling me for much less critical stuff, like switching hyclate to monohydrate or capsule to tablet (I know this might be attributable to regulation). \n\nI know corporate pharmacies are super busy and pharmacy staff are extremely overworked, but the number of times I've seen patients inappropriately sent home without meds makes me think that *some* pharmacists (not all, not even most) might possibly be overstepping. However, I might not be understanding the full situation at hand.\n\nI hope someone here can explain the nuances of this situation so I can understand this better instead of egotistically grumbling about someone questioning my masterful clinical judgement (/s) and causing my patient the inconvenience. Is there a new corporate policy, computer software flag, or federal regulation about this?",

The average retail pharmacist isn\u2019t going to deal with it enough to know the differences between the forms of keratitis or appropriate therapies. \n\nAs far as calling you on it, without knowing the specific situation there have been instances where it took me 6+ hours to have a chance to call for clarification because there is so much stuff going on. And this was years ago, from what I understand things are even worse now than when I was last in outpatient. \n\nI\u2019m also hesitant to fully take patients at their word when they say prescriptions were refused, I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve had patients hear that their refill was too early or we had to call for clarification/PA and relay to the doctor that we were refusing to fill it. \n\nOn calling you about dosage forms, it was a waste of our time too.

Furthermore this kid had already been taking it for some time and so the risk of suicidal ideation was greatly mitigated.\n\nInstead of calling for clarification, the pharmacist just blocked it without discussion.",

    "text": "*For National Novel Writing Month in 2023, I started writing a collection of medical stories. This is the dedication to the work.*\n\nI knew M for a year and a half \u2013 a lifetime in the world of palliative care. She was one of my very first patients in oncology clinic. An easy patient, my consultant told me. Metastatic breast cancer for several years, well-controlled. But then she was missing at her next clinic visit.\n\nI found her at the bedside of our new patient, P. P was newly diagnosed, but already he had been in the hospital twice. He had one of those diseases that makes you gasp when you look at the scans. Bones, liver, lungs, adrenals. Disease lighting up from brain down spine. It is easy to see the future in such pictures.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s my husband,\u201d M said.\n\nI saw first him, then her. I learned that he had been losing weight for months \u2013 stressed from caring for her, they had thought. He had not sought help because he had been too worried about her health.\n\nWe planned his treatment. Sent him home. He came back two days later, raving, delirious. It was the height of COVID and his family were in New Zealand. I wrote a letter to the government begging for understanding. More forms for P to be treated as an inpatient. Radiotherapy, tranquilisers. P slept a lot. When he was awake, he was less agitated, but frightened, clinging. It took him effort to look me in the eyes and speak.\n\nI want to go home, he said. Every time I saw him, he asked me that.\n\nHis sister arrived from New Zealand. With her here, M said, they would manage at home. He had tolerated a second lot of treatment. He was less confused, smiling, eager to show us how much stronger he was. Against my better instincts, we let him go home.\n\nThey were back in less than twenty-four hours. I remember my consultant asking me if they could find a bed at the hospice in time for him to get there. I said to her that I did not think he even had time to leave the emergency department.\n\nIn the room, P\u2019s sister kissed him with the names of each of his loved ones who could not be there, sending their love. I held M as she sobbed in my arms. \u201cHe was such a beautiful man,\u201d she said, or I said. I can\u2019t remember anymore.\n\nI did not see M at the next clinic visit. Over the course of the year I would spot her occasionally in waiting rooms, each time looking a little different. She was often with P\u2019s sister. Having come to look after P, she had decided to stay and they had become good friends, M told me, smiling. I thought of the report that I had read: brain and liver lesions growing.\n\nThe next year, working in hospice. I came back from annual leave and saw M\u2019s name on my list. A common name, I thought, but I knew. When I walked into the room, she did not recognise me at first, but when I pulled down my mask she cried out and reached to touch me, as if to confirm I existed. \u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201d\n\nStaff came in to clean up breakfast. She would not let them leave until she introduced me to them: \u201cThis is my friend and doctor. She\u2019s come all the way from the other hospital to look after me.\u201d\n\nI did not have the heart to correct her, not in this nor when she told me that she had come to do a little bit of rehabilitation. She was on a treatment break, she said, but soon she would be stronger and would go home. There are always more treatments.\n\nA few days pass. M does not get up. She has liver failure and progressive brain metastases. She brightens when I enter the room, but otherwise she seems quiet and shrunken. I think of P at the end, how diminished he had seemed. We share one conversation about him. I tell her that I will never forget him, one of the most beautiful men I have ever met. Fiercely, she agrees. Then she fades away again.\n\nMy consultant comes to meet her for the first time. I tell him of our history and he listens gravely. I tell him that she was very confused on yesterday\u2019s ward round and I am not sure she will be able to speak to him.\n\nWe go into the room. He greets her softly, asks how she is. M does not respond. He asks instead how her spirit is. Again, a long silence.\n\nThen she answers: \u201cAll my life, I never stopped to ponder.\u201d\n\nSometimes our patients give us such gifts. These words, so strangely poetic, which I will never forget. That moment in which the entire world seemed to shrink to just that room, to the two of us around her bed. Even the light seemed to contract, as if it were a spotlight upon her. The sound of her breathing, her pauses, as she fought through the fog of pain, delirium and liver failure to tell us her story. Sometimes she would beat her fist against the bed in frustration, searching for the words her brain was no longer able to conjure, thoughts slipping like sand through fingers.\n\n\u201cI rushed through my life. I was stupid, to never think\u2026 All my life, I never did anything.\u201d She silences our attempts to reassure her, shaking her head, her eyes closed. \u201cI\u2019m an ordinary woman. Just ordinary. There is nothing special about me. The only thing I have special is my love of God.\u201d\n\nShe falls silent. My consultant waits a moment, then prompts gently: \u201cAnd how are your daughters doing?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, my children.\u201d Almost, she smiles. \u201cThey\u2019re special. The only special things I leave. My daughters\u2026My daughter is strong, so strong. She doesn\u2019t know how strong she is.\u201d Only now does her voice break, and I know who these words were meant for. \u201cI never knew how much she loved me.\u201d\n\nHer voice is a whisper. Fragments of phrases, strung together by ghosts of reason. \u201cSometimes I am glad. If not for this, I would never have known how much\u2026all these people in my life\u2026I would have missed it\u2026\u201d\n\nI never heard her voice again.\n\nI dreamt of being an author since I was young. I imagined the books I would write, the dedications I would put inside them. How I would use them as a gift to thank the people I loved most. How happy that would make them! How small, how selfish that conception of dedication seems now. Now the meanings of dedication have proliferated in my life: the dedication of patient and loved ones to each other, of doctor to patient and patient to doctor, of doctor and writer to the art.\n\nAnd so I dedicate this work: *to P and M*.",

Many of those people need or want treatment but have not yet received any. Research shows that treatment of OUD is most effective when medications are used.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nPrimary care prescribers treating other chronic health conditions are in a key position to also prescribe medications for OUD. A DATA waiver (X-waiver), long considered a barrier preventing health care providers from prescribing buprenorphine, is no longer required.\u00a0\n\nMany primary care providers find that prescribing medications to treat OUD is easier than they thought it would be. Hear firsthand testimonials from providers, find free training and other resources to help you get started, **by visiting the campaign\u2019s webpage,** [Prescribe with Confidence](https://cutt.ly/WetFQRNj). \n\n**Help spread the word,** especially with health care providers and the organizations that support them.\u00a0 \n\nMedications for opioid use disorder save lives. \n\n**Tell us your success stories or what is holding you back** (other practitioners in your office, reimbursement, time, lack of knowledge, etc.).\u00a0\n\n[Prescribe with Confidence](https://cutt.ly/WetFQRNj)\u00a0\u00a0\n\n[Dr. Califf Introducing the Campaign](https://youtu.be/6wZ4H9ZnUiY)\u00a0\n\n[Dr. Hahn MOUD Success Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iWHFZLAR5E&t=3s)\u00a0\u00a0",

It\u2019s just frustrating because we have no convenient and compliant way of communicating about patients between our offices. \n\nI do take people who aren\u2019t in treatment as a harm reduction measure, but it\u2019s hard to safely induce them. Medicaid doesn\u2019t like paying for strips, so microdosing can be a challenge. We don\u2019t have the physical space or staff to monitor people during induction. I have done home inductions with patients who seemed to understand the process (most of them have used subs before, either prescribed or street) and had good support.\n\nStaffing is the main issue for me expanding my buprenorphine practice (or practice in general). We don\u2019t even have enough staff to answer the phones, arrange medicaid transport and do prior authorization in a timely manner.  Increasing rates of induction, UDS\u2019s, frequent controlled substance script renewals, etc. is asking a lot for our overstretched staff. Our payer mix is heavily medicaid, so we don\u2019t even pay competively compared to Walmart. \n\nTreating OUD is easier than treating most of my DM2 patients.

    "text": "Kinda having a moral quandary and wanted to see how people feel about it. I am a heme/onc attending in a small-ish community private practice and we collaborate with a small community hospital down the street. We have, as a practice, struggled with how long it takes for us to work up our patients. Because it\u2019s a community practice, any hint of cancer comes our way and we work it up. We then order the CT\u2019s, the PETs, the biopsies, MRIs..etc. This process has taken too long, ~ 3wks. It then takes about another week to 10 days to book a chemo chair. We have talked about this before with radiology and the proceduralists and we basically settled that there isn\u2019t much that can be done and that if you need a more expedited work up then you admit the patient. I don\u2019t like it. It\u2019s a work in progress. \n\nThe quandary comes, as you may have surmised, when I was referred an employee. Very nice guy, career hospital employee, jumped around a few departments. New diagnosis. I ordered the work up. Everything was booked and done in 3 days. Not an exaggeration. 72 hrs. Path came back a week later so I was able to fit him in for a visit a couple days after that. We talked about chemo, consents signed. Treatment booked another 2 days later. So a process that usually take 4-5 weeks, took about 11 days. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I get the \u201cwe take care of our own mentality.\u201d This is someone who has put in a lot of work in the hospital, helping people. So we need to take care of him. But this isn\u2019t giving him extra meat at the deli, or giving an extra discount on tires. He cut in line in front of people that equally need an expedited work up. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I totally get that the problem here is that the work up takes too long because the system is broken. I am not arguing there. But is it ok to have the system be less-broken for you, only because you are a part of that system? ",

Yeah we could be setting ourselves on fire to work 18h days on the regular as if every person was this colleague, but that\u2019s not sustainable. Doing one extra case as a favor is. \n\nBut either way, the cynical side of me doesn\u2019t have any qualms about this.

    "text": "My shop previously used fioricet for headache in SAH pts. Had a pt post IR coil and embolization for ruptured wide neck aneurysm. Pt developed hydrocephalus and then had an EVD placed. Pt had a good amount of CSF drained, usually 150 to 200 ccs every 24 hrs. 16 days later the EVD had been clamped for nearly 24 hrs, no drainage and ICPs had been 3 to 15 mmHg. Drain was likely going to be removed with no shunt required. TCDs have been negative since they were initiated.\n\nWe recently totally changed our providers to a completely new neurosurgical service . They are absolutely against using Fioricet due to it being implicated in causing vasospasm. I had looked up the paper and indeed it seemed highly likely to contribute to vasospasm in SAH pts.\n\nPt had severe headaches that were refractory to other meds, so Fioricet was ordered and then advanced to 2 tabs Q4 right before the incident. Pt was GCS 15 and NIH of 0 at 0600 when I gave Fioricet and Nimodipine. At 0630 pt could not move LUE and had left facial droop. They were still AAOx4 and had no other deficits and normal sensation. NIH increased from 0 to 5 - no effort against gravity, lethargic but arousable with repeated stimulation, and minor facial paralysis.pt could slightly move fingers off and on. Stat CT showed no new bleeds and they were taken to IR for treatment of vasospasm.\n\nHas anyone had experience with Fioricet causing vasospasm? Pt was pretty stable throughout stay except for periods of moderate lethargy. Is anyone else using Fioricet for headaches in SAH pts, or is it not commonplace in other shops?

Aside from the voodoo around the pathophys of cerebral vasospasm, you're giving barbiturates to a patient that's going to have headaches for weeks. It can be sedating (bad), create dependence (bad), can create nasty rebound headaches, etc. It has a half life of like 30-40 hours, I suspect increases the risk of adding in benzos (like sedation for someone squirming around on an angio table while treating spasm or replacing an EVD at bedside), the list goes on and on.\n\nFrom a spasm standpoint, I don't know of any substantive literature that would support its role in spasm. But if another person on reddit chimes in and says  \"I've also seen someone have spasm on fioricet\" you should not draw any conclusions from that. Something like 25% of patients have symptomatic spasm. With an incidence that high, anything seen in two out of 30,000 annual patients with aSAH unfortunately proves nothing.\n\nJust give them a few doses of steroids, it's what we do for everything anyways. They do a lot of bad, but they help with the meningeal irritation - even better (in my experience) for patients with aSAH related radicular pain in their legs or low back pain.",

Had first migraine at age 12 and it was horrible. Fioricet has always worked, as well as tryptans, but the tryptans seem to be causing some chest pain due to vasoconstriction of the coronary arteries and the cardiologist advises against them for me, but I did use them for about 15 years, with Fioricet as an emergency-relief drug while waiting the 3 hours for the tryptan to work. I have been tried on ergot (Wigraine), midodrine (no effect), and opioids. Way back, a beta blocker, not effective, and another antihypertensive that had no effect, and Celebrex. Opioids were totally useless for my headaches. If Fioricet is taken off the market, I will be back in the dark room for 12 hours at a time - I had to do that too many times, missed work, and I cannot live like that. I am an active person. It does not cause sedation at all unless I have had to take 3 doses (@ 1 tab q 4 hours). Usually one or two doses and a cup of coffee takes care of the headache. This drug has been a life saver for me most of my life. During the brief periods I was not taking it, I achieved nothing in grad courses, clinical work, as a professor, research work, and family life because of the headaches. If I had Fioricet, no problem with any of those activities, no sedation, and headache would be gone in about 20-30 minutes. \n\nMy father and his mother also suffered from migraines. My father took aspirin and suffered through them grimly. In my grandmother's day she retreated to the dark room. For too many days.",

It's been impossible to get records from their previous psychiatrists. We send ROIs, ask the patient to call, I call, my staff calls, and there's just crickets in response.  Since there is are limited resources for outpatient psychiatric care in my area I often end up managing their conditions and really need their records to confirm their diagnoses and treatment history. Also when I try to refer to psychiatry locally, they sometimes won't see the patient until previous records are obtained. Is there a reason it is such a struggle to get psych records specifically?

For Republicans, a modest investment in health and education cut costs and increased productivity. For Democrats, it was simply a moral good - the right thing to do. Now, Democrats make the argument that public investment will pay greater dividends - that socialized medicine saves more in the long run than the current system. Republicans, meanwhile, advocate against all welfare except for the biggest corporations.\n\n\nWhat happened to taking care of people because *it\u2019s the right thing to do*??\n\n\nI run a [charity](https://www.pbjwatch.org) because I think the problem of feeding people is mostly technical and I propose a technical solution.

    "text": "1. The mRNA vaccines cause infertility - it doesn't\n2. The vaccines are still \"experimental\" - They are not, over 3.8 BILLION doses have been given. \n3. The p\u1d09\u028co\u0254 vaccine has nanobots - lol\n4. The p\u1d09\u028co\u0254 vaccine has a microchip in it - it doesn't, the microchip is in your phone and the facebook app you are using\n5. I can't get it \"insert some medical reason\" - This is obviously a discussion you should have with your doctor, however- if you are truly one of the less than 1% of people who it is recommended against you should be encouraging everyone else to get the vaccine as you are very high risk to die from p\u1d09\u028co\u0254.\n6.  buy and hodl doge\n7.  I am pregnant, I can\u2019t get it \u2013 yes you can and should, pregnant women are high risk to end up in the ICU/die from p\u1d09\u028co\u0254.  \n8.  Masks don\u2019t help protect from respiratory illness \u2013 lol\n9.  FDA hasn\u2019t approved it yet \u2013 Yes, they have.  They just have a mechanism to approve things quicker called an EUA.  The only reason it is still under the EUA is because of their antiquated waiting period. \n10.  I am young and healthy so p\u1d09\u028co\u0254 won\u2019t affect me \u2013 See our current ICU census\n11.  We have other effective treatments such as ivermectin, HCQ, etc \u2013 No we don\u2019t. None of them have shown any benefit in p\u1d09\u028co\u0254.  We have a vaccine and oxygen and a breathing tube. \n12. The government can\u2019t mandate things, this is America \u2013 see seatbelts\n13.  There is a controversy among physicians, there are two sides \u2013 no there aren\u2019t.  There are 58000 Emergency Medicine physicians in the US.  96% of them are vaccinated.  \n14.  I don\u2019t know who to believe \u2013 Believe physicians, epidemiologists, etc.  Don\u2019t believe your cousin on facebook.  If I have a plumbing problem, I am going to call a plumber.  I don\u2019t ask the plumber about rumors I heard on facebook on why he is using a sharkbite fitting vs a pressure fitting.  \n15.  God will protect me \u2013 God is protecting you if you choose to accept it, he gave us a vaccine for a reason\n16.  The pharmaceutical companies are just in it for the money \u2013 possibly true but: Pfizer wants you to live so they can make more money.  E.G. Viagra \u2013 dead people don\u2019t buy Viagra\n17.  Vaccines have bad long-term effects \u2013 no they don\u2019t, we have been vaccinating people for almost 100 years.  All the side effects happen in the first ~3 weeks.  P\u1d09\u028co\u0254 has bad long-term effects.\n18.  none of the politicians I trust have gotten vaccine\n19.  Experts posting on facebook doesn\u2019t do anything \u2013it does, more than you know.  I know that hundreds of people have made the decision to get vaccinated at least partly from my and other physicians\u2019 posts. \n20.  Us vaccinated folk need to not worry about other peoples vaccination status \u2013 yes we do.  My kids can\u2019t get vaccinated.  I am on an experimental immune modulator(so I have no idea how protected I am).  I also worry about people running stop signs.  \n21.  All opinions matter \u2013 they do not E.G., the big lebowsky\n22.  The vaccine is dangerous \u2013 it is thousands of times less dangerous than p\u1d09\u028co\u0254\n23.  I will not get p\u1d09\u028co\u0254 \u2013 yes you will\n24.  I already had p\u1d09\u028co\u0254, so I don\u2019t need a vaccine \u2013 The science is still out on this.  However, every physician I know who had p\u1d09\u028co\u0254 also got the vaccine.  The data shows you are more protected from the vaccine than from p\u1d09\u028co\u0254.  We don\u2019t know how long the protection lasts from either.  I am currently recommending the vaccine to anyone who is recovered from p\u1d09\u028co\u0254.  You don\u2019t have to wait months to get it.\n25.  I had p\u1d09\u028co\u0254 before there was p\u1d09\u028co\u0254 \u2013 ok p\u1d09\u028co\u0254 hipster\n26.  Private businesses can\u2019t require a vaccine \u2013 yes, they can.  I am currently lobbying for all events, restaurants, and everything fun in New Orleans to require a vaccination.",

Hasn't researched why, but who cares.\n\nThe Historian - Hails from a community which has previously undergone medical experimentation.\n\nThe Immortalist - Young and oblivious.\n\nThe Reactionary - Themselves or someone they know had a bad reaction to a medication in the past, now they are being cautious. Sometimes legit, most other times has totally overlooked the current Pandemic body count and drug risk profiles.\n\nThe Naturalist - Thinks that the \"unnatural\" vaccine is more dangerous than COVID, also typically willing to eat veg cuisine processed with an astonishing array of chemicals. Prefers getting the disease to safely combating COVID-19 by fooling your body into manufacturing vaccine-induced antibodies without the whole death or long term disability.\n\nThe Politico - Has replaced political opinions for all facets of personal decisionmaking. \n\nThe Distracted - Focuses in on every experimental treatment known to maybe treat COVID but refuses to destroy it with what is essentially a magic bullet.\n\nThe Religious - Can't get beyond the idea that the current vaccines were manufacturing using abortion products or something of the sort.\n\nThe Incapacitated - Can't make their own decisions, caretakers and decisionmakers are members of one of the above.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDid I miss any?",

    "title": "The CAR-T Question",
    "text": "\nCAR-T cells are a novel therapy for haematological malignancies. The patients own immune cells are collected, and genetically modified recombinant T-cells with Chimaeric Antigen Receptors that both recognise and cause proliferation of cell populations can be engineered with CD19 targets, to reprogram the immune system to fight off lymphomas and leukaemias that express this surface protein. A potential miracle cure, piggy-backing on our own immune system to give hyper-targeted chemotherapy, with the potential to snatch the fortunate back from the jaws of death. That's the blurb that you'll read on the news or in popular science magazines, anyway. \n\nIn reality, it's a different ballgame. Those eligible for CAR-T cells have failed a couple of lines of conventional chemotherapy, and they come to the hospital recognisably \"cancer patients\". It might not be the correct way to put it, but we recognise them from a mile away. The sallow skin. The sunken eyes. The paucity of hair. The look of a young person who has faded back from their full, fat, rich life to a shadow of what they had been. I always admired their resilience, their drive, their commitment to living when just living took more effort than any of us can normally muster.\n\nThey come in after a few days of conditioning chemotherapy, with a lot of behind the scenes fanfare marking their arrival. They're discussed at numerous MDTs, and they are the talk of the ward for days before. The consultant involved asks about them a few times - almost surreptitiously. \"Oh has the new CAR-T come in yet? Yeah, no, they should be here at some point today. Just make sure you get a CRP as soon as possible and I'm not on call, but give me a ring about the result anyway yeah?\"\n\nThe patient arrives on the first of my night shifts. She's a few months younger than I am. She's been through three lines of chemotherapy for her Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. Her PICC line - a Peripherally Inserted Central Cannula; a \u201cdrip\u201d that can deliver chemotherapy and stay in place for the duration of her stay in hospital - has been put in the previous day, but it's a hurting a bit when it\u2019s used. Tellingly, it's just been flushed, and she develops a fever straight after, suggesting it harbours an infection.\n\nI chat to her at length as I explain that we will take line cultures but not pull it out yet - but we will give her strong antibiotics and hope to salvage the line. I employ the kind of jovial, light patter that has carried me through hundreds of similar situations - blending an explanation of what I'm doing with gentle humour to defuse the weight in the room. I plan to insert a cannula, take bloods, and start the Domestos blend of antibiotics - piperacillin/tazobactam, ciprofloxacin and vancomycin. I request a chest X-ray, urinalysis and cultures to confirm the source of the infection. She cries a little bit as she outlines her hopes for CAR-T cells. I can tell she needs to talk - she has been sat in clinic from 9am and she's just got on to the ward at 11pm - it has been a difficult day. It's the last thing she can try. I've seen more tears than I care to admit - and I start to make the cooing noises and gentle words that have served me so well in so many similar situations. I'm trying to stay active, stay busy, and wrap myself in the plummy complacency that we often use to distance ourselves from the emotional burden of our patients.\n\n\"I know there's nothing else. Even if they came up with CAR-U V W X Y Zs, I don't want any more. I've had a good life, I've made my peace before. I was ready to die before they offered this. Don't get me wrong, I want it to work more than I've ever wanted anything else. But I know it can go either way. I know if this doesn't work, that's me done. I'm out. No more.\"\n\nI'm dumbfounded by her eloquent candidacy. She's 31, with a husband and a young family. I see death every day, but I haven't considered my mortality in any detail at all - not like this. My own perspective on life goes under the microscope every time I think about chatting to her from that day on, and my armour is stripped away entirely. To see her in any less of a light would be a great disservice to her, and to my own humanity and morals. I feel uneasy about the idea of opening up like this - but my instinct is to let it happen. She is simultaneously determined and blithesome, but the subtext of the importance of the situation is obvious.\n\nThe cannula goes in easily, I take just a few minutes to explain things to her, and I check up on her a couple of hours later. She calls me \"the best doctor ever\". I smile inwardly - it's just a cannula, and the praise means nothing - but she's speaking back to me like I'm a real person; her humanity shines through and I consequently see her in the same light. Counter-transference, they call it - I recognise this, yet I go along still. The night quietens down, and I get some sleep.\n\nAt 6am, I'm asked to go see her. She's spiking a fever, and she's vomited up blood. There\u2019s a small amount of fresh blood in her sick bowl - as I walk in to the room, she winks - \u201cI made ya a present!\u201d. She has been receiving conditioning chemotherapy but didn\u2019t have any of the usual stomach protection tablets prescribed - more than likely she has a little ulcer or gastric erosion as a side effect of the steroids she has been taking for the last 5 days. Her blood pressure and pulse are fine, so I\u2019m not too worried, but I try to figure out her Glasgow-Blatchford score grading the severity of gastrointestinal bleeding in my head as I examine her, and I note a red, tender area over the tract of her PICC line. \n\nI discuss it with the registrar - I think I should pull the line immediately, but he disagrees. He ends up pulling it 3 hours later when he sees her. I'm new to haematology, so I understand why he wouldn't act on my instincts. But I wish he would have done. I already wish that anything possible should be done to help her. \n\nI give up and enter her parameters into an online calculator for the Blatchford score - 10 points - requires urgent oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (an OGD - a camera down the throat to look into the stomach and fix whatever may be fixed). I request the OGD for that day and speak to the gastro consultant. The words \"CAR-T\" carry a lot of weight - \u00a3250,000 as a minimum is a pretty heavy amount, after all. He hears them and doesn\u2019t need the rest of the story - he says he'll scope her first on the list. I have an odd sinking feeling - I was buoyed by the novelty and promise of the treatment, but I sense that things may be more complicated than they seem. Clinical gestalt? Human worry? I don't know.\n\nThat's the first hurdle for her. The OGD happily confirms a minor erosion, but the next 2 weeks are a series of unfortunate events, with bacteraemia after kidney failure after blood clot. By some miracle, she ends up being fit to get her conditioning treatment completed, and has the CAR-T cell infusion on the last day possible. She has no visitors there for this momentous occasion. I make well-worn jokes about not dropping it because we'll need a mortgage to get more, and make light of the lack of drama. She laughs as I apologise that it isn't like the scene in a Marvel film, where a luminescent liquid in a drip causes muscles to suddenly bulge and eyes to widen immediately - the only superpower she will get is an odd smell of overcooked cabbage and sweetcorn in her sweat for the next few weeks, from the preservative used to buffer the stem cells.\n\nI have a good amount of time on my nights. I'm revising for PACES, the final and most gruelling part of my postgraduate exams. Every evening, after finishing my immediate jobs but before hitting the books and hunting out rare murmurs on the cardiology wards, I go to chat to her for a couple of hours or sometimes more. We talk about anything but medicine and illness. We compare travel stories. We talk about our friends. We dissect music and TV shows, the places we have lived in the UK, our childhoods, relationships and families. One day, I have to apologise as our chat continues until the sun comes up. I find myself wishing her treatment works harder than any of the other patients - I think about her at home, when driving, whilst dealing with other patients. She's a normal person just like me or you - she's more than just the NHL in bed 36 Day+12 CAR-T. Can't everyone else see that?\n\nThere's an issue in communication between the day and night registrars, and she ends up receiving tocilizumab. This is an antibody to IL-6. IL-6 can be released in a cytokine storm, a rare complication of CAR-T cell treatment, where the immune system over-activates. It\u2019s the talk of the world now, as it can occur in COVID-19 infection, but it\u2019s otherwise vanishingly rare. It presents with fever, hypotension and neurological sequalae. \n\nThere is a saying in medicine - \u201cWhen you hear hoof beats, look for horses, not zebras.\u201d This means - common things are common, and you shouldn\u2019t look for rare causes before considering the most likely ones. \n\nThe horses say she is febrile, because of her multiple infections, and hypotensive, because she is a 50kg 31 year old lady with a baseline systolic blood pressure of 100. The consultant doesn't want it given, but it is prescribed overnight. The risk is that it may also impede the action of the CAR-T cells. The decision to give it is probably justifiable - but I bristle at the idea of anything harming her chances. In the coming weeks, I think back to the day it was given, and wish I had shown the guts to break the hierarchy, call the consultant, and prevent it. It wouldn't have made a difference - but in the \"bargaining\" stage, it adds to the spiralling thoughts in my mind each night.\n\nThe trajectory becomes more and more blindingly obvious. She's not improving. Problems mount. The infections recur and recur. There's frank haematuria - her catheter bag looks uncannily like a unit of red blood cells for transfusion. An ultrasound of the abdomen is not very revealing, but the subsequent CT confirms invasion of tumour material into the kidneys. A pleural effusion develops. The abdominal mass grows. A chest drain goes in. Out. In. Out. The renal team say they'll dialyse (remember, she's a CAR-T - they would probably do ECMO at the drop of a hat here) when we give the word. I dread \u201cthe word\u201d because it will mean another large bore central line, another hideous augmentation, another concession to disease over life. \n\nShe is in more pain each day. She has realised it's failing. She knows deep down that it's not going to work.\nWe know it too. But we have to keep going. This is an experimental treatment, and there have been miraculous turnarounds before - we have all read about the man with tumours taking over nearly his entire brain who walked off from what was certain to be his deathbed after CAR-T treatment. We hope against hope.\n\nHer partner spends every moment by her bedside now. Her mum has rushed back from her holiday to be there. I feel cruel as I speak to the respiratory reg and ask him to put a chest drain back in this skeleton that was her just a week ago. The burden of the treatments seems to be overtaking the other myriad sources of pain and misery in this poor lady's life. I sigh with relief as her bloods come back each day and tell us that dialysis isn\u2019t on the cards yet. I question my role, my actions, my very being, more often and more deeply than is good for me.\n\nMostly, I feel like a fraud. I don't know why we would put anyone through all this. I find it hard to sleep because I can't stop thinking about the suffering we're causing. We would have palliated anyone at this point - but this is CAR-T. We have to follow the protocol! With the new treatment, we have to follow the established protocol before assessing response with a day 30 PET-CT scan, as we don't know what point the CAR-T cells may become effective. We target everything towards this scan - a focal point to offer us all some hope. When we have developed our knowledge of these new techniques, it will be possible to deviate from these fixed ideals - but that offers no comfort today. \n\nI see her on a Thursday. I have a long weekend off. I'm not even meant to be in that day- I was doing an audit - but the sister tells me she's not feeling very well, and the on call SHO is down in the ED.\nI go in her room, and her whole family are around. \"Hey Mo\" they chorus. \"You're here! I know you'll be able to help!\" she smiles, her whole face still managing to light up as we have a chat about what is troubling her and what has worked for her before. The conversation is punctuated by ugly, wet coughs, and the beautiful, genuine grin struggles to mask the grimaces that force their way through. I prescribe subcutaneous morphine and levomepromazine. I'm glad to see her settled and sleeping when I leave, although the weight of commencing the \"end of life\" drugs tempers my relief, if not hers. I cancel my plans that evening, and I don\u2019t do an awful lot the whole weekend. \n\nI come back on Monday and the decision to palliate has been made early that morning. I'm in clinic all day, but at 6pm I pop up to the ward and I go in to the room. She's naked beneath the bed sheet, agitated and shivering. Her partner looks ashen faced - dry eyes with no tears left. I exchange those stunted, awkward words with him; each syllable carrying an unbearable weight as I vaguely pay tribute to her resolve, and to his. I touch her on the shoulder and she cries out delirious gibberish, and for the first time in years, my heart aches like she is one of my own.\n\nI don't see her again. The next day, during the morning board round, my registrar gives me a squeeze on the shoulder and a momentary look as we wordlessly skip past her empty bed - this taciturn act the most acknowledgement that either of us can bear. The brief reverie is broken by the shrill cry of the phone. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bereavement. What time will you be able to go down and do the paperwork? We have two CAR-Ts coming in at 1 o clock, should I say before then?\u201d\n\nI feign an engagement and leave the paperwork and verification to someone else. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have to grow my skin any thicker, 6 years in. \n\nYoung patients with no effective treatment options are hard to swallow. When the whole process is tied up with the moral quandary of whether we are doing good or harm, it becomes an even more difficult scenario to deal with. As a patient, she was perhaps the first time I felt the blur of the boundary, and I considered her a friend, too. Not in the kind of way to jeopardise the professional relationship - but her character transcended my usual defences. I carry her memory, and I will forever. I hope that she remembers me too.",

I appreciate that fact that you spent any extra time you had hanging out and talking with this patient because unfortunately not too many providers do. I have seen the push back as to when it is time to go palliative/hospice because it is CAR T, we must keep going until that 30 day PET scan. Unfortunately you have those gut feelings it might not have worked even before the images say otherwise. For me the hardest part is when patients ask, when will have I have symptoms, if I don't does that mean it isn't working. Unfortunately I don't know the percentages of that but even people who ended up with CRS and neurotoxicities who take a trip to the MICU have relapsed and died. Their bodies do what we expect it to and hold off on Toci or steroids until they absolutely need it but that doesn't determine a positive outcome. On the other hand we have people who are alive to this day from over two years ago of CAR T who are still in remission and look great. I just remind myself that it will be impossible to save everyone but for those that we do are so appreciative of getting their life back. They never forget the ones who helped them during that battle. Keep doing what you are doing because there will be a next patient who will make it.",

As an anaesthetist/intensivist it often frustrates me the lengths oncologists go to to push chemo in clearly EoL patients, and then want us to provide critical care that has no hope of achieving anything. Reading stories like yours helps bring me down to earth and realise the humanity that is still left in medicine. It's not my place to judge because I'm not a medic or part of their parent team. It's easy to be detached when I'm only hearing a snippet during a referral. \n\nThis person isn't just a hospital number and the empathy and care that you show makes me glad there are medics like you out there. It's an impossible task to balance caring enough with staying detached so it doesn't weigh you down irrevocably. Even if you couldn't change the end result you provided wonderful relief at a difficult point in time for her and no doubt had a hugely positive influence in the last days of her life. It's a big burden to bear but it'll make you a better physician. \n\nI've never been one to chat loads to patients, I'm terrible at that. I am rather envious of your ability to do that. Perhaps that's why I chose this specialty where I can't wait to get them asleep fast enough. Please don't change, keep up this attitude, the caring, the compassion, you sound like an amazing med reg to work with. All the best.",

    "title": "Vitronectin: the missing link between SARS-CoV-2 and thrombotic risk or another innocent bystander in damage from autoimmunity by the adaptive immune response?",
    "text": "Different phenotypes and sub-phenotypes of Covid-19 are continuing to pop into view. The silent hypoxemic or L phenotype^1 has been a recent source of deliberation using anecdotal evidence in affected areas. This \u201csilent hypoxemic\u201d patient with very low oxygen saturation calmly rests in the stretcher. Is the solution to apply PEEP to recruit alveolar units, or is there something else at play?\n\nThere have been many hypotheses as to why these patients are so comfortable and while they are incredibly hypoxemic. Shunt physiology, hypoxic vasoconstriction, pulmonary microangiopathy, VTE, atelectotrauma, and other causes have been considered.\n\nThe Italians reported that the L phenotype can switch to the H phenotype very rapidly^1 .\n\nAnecdotally there seems to be a subset of patients with high inflammatory markers and markedly elevated d-dimers/FSP. There are even reports of hyper-coagulability (especially if on CRRT) and various venous and arterial thromboembolic phenomena.\n\nTo understand the missing link between SARS-CoV-2 and hypercoagulability we must take a step back to SARS. Chen, B. et al found that in SARS \n>a form of disseminated intravascular coagulation or unusually disseminated small vessel thrombosis in the lungs with consumption of platelets and clotting factors. [Autopsy] indicated the presence of vascular fibrin thrombi, pulmonary alveoli capillary microthromboses or thromboembolic bronchial\narterioles^2 . \nThere is clearly an indication of hyper-coagulability in a subset of SARS patients. \n\nWhat followed next in this paper is very interesting:\n>Further investigations are needed to understand the exorbitant increase of [vitronectin] in the infectious pneumonia patients; to our knowledge, these are the highest VN values observed in blood plasma of patients ever. In the presence of VN, PAI-1 displays a 200-fold accelerated thrombin inhibition and may compete with urokinase-receptor dependent or integrin-dependent binding of cells to the extracellular matrix. Multimeric VN (derived from platelets) also supports thrombus formation and stabilization after vascular injury. It remains to be established whether these dramatically elevated VN levels originate from expression in the liver (the main organ of VN production) or from lung damage, and whether they correlate with thrombotic complications in SARS patients^2 .\n\nI\u2019m no hematologist nor have heard of vitronectin in my training. So I dug deeper.\n\n\n**What is vitronectin (VN)?**\n>[an] adhesive protein that supports the attachment and spreading on glass of \u2018unadapted\u2019\ncells^3 .\u201d \nThis protein is used to plate various stem cells in laboratory experimentation. It is also an acute phase reactant, produced in response to stress^4. \n>in response to acute tissue injury, VN interacts directly with the elements of the complement and coagulation cascades, contributes to\nthrombus formation, stability of vessel occlusion and subsequent inflammation and immune responses^3 . \n\n**What is VN\u2019s function?**\nVN binds to and stabilizes plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 which in turn inhibits tPA,\nleading to a prothrombotic state. In the extracellular non-aqueous environment, it may act as a heparin binder or scavenger^3.\n\nIt also inhibits a specific part of the complement cascade:\n>hinder[ing] the insertion of the C5b-7\ninto the cell membrane and thus precludes the downstream completion with C9 to form the MAC\nlytic pore^6 .\n\nBy binding and preventing the complement cascade, viral infected cells may escape destruction through NK triggered apoptosis.\nVN has also been shown to play a part in platelet recruitment and stabilization^6. \n\n\n**What is the significance of extremely high VN and how to we potentially treat it?**\nHigh levels of VN could be why we are seeing this hypercoagulable state. Unfortunately VN levels are not a standard test, so this remains to be evaluated for SARS-CoV-2. There is a possible subtype of patients that do not respond to heparin, and maybe this is because of the heparin scavenging properties of VN. Impairment of the innate immune response and possible lymphocytic vasculitis as seen in some autopsy case series in SARS and SARS-CoV-2 may be responsive to corticosteroids.\n\nThere could also be a subset of patients that develop autoimmune effects. Since most of this sub-phenotype shows worsening symptoms around 10-12 days after presentation (anecdotally), autoantibodies or cross-reactivity with antibodies directed at SARS-CoV-2 epitopes may induce an autoimmune inflammatory reaction:\n>Autoantibodies against pulmonary epithelial cells and endothelial cells have been detected in SARS patients. These autoantibodies may cause cytotoxic injury to the pulmonary epithelial cells and may induce systemic vasculitis, both frequently observed in SARS autopsies. Autoimmunity may be partially attributable to the development of cross-reacting antibodies against specific SARS-CoV epitopes. IgG antibodies against the domain 2 of spike protein have indeed been found to cross-react with pulmonary epithelial cells. Another mechanism that possibly explains autoimmunity is the exposure of autoantigens caused by cytokine-induced organ injury ^7 .\n\n\n**Next steps:** \nSee if VN truly is elevated in Covid-19 hypercoagulable and inflammatory sub-phenotype. Find out if the VN levels or hypercoagulable effect improves with decreasing inflammation and blunting the lymphocytic vasculitic effect of the disease. We also need a closer look at the utility of non heparin-based anticoagulation. We might just be able to blunt the so-called \u2018second hit.\u2019\n\nReferences:\n\n1. Gattinoni L. et al.

    "text": "Howdy Folks.\n\nSomeone in my life just excitedly told me about the approval to use Plaquenil and azithromycin in COVID. I believe their knowledge of this and excitement about it is, at least in part, politically-driven. I slammed this out real quick after listening to the latest TWIV episode. Please tell me your thoughts and correct me where I'm wrong.  \n\n\n>I have a few thoughts on experimental drug usage in the COVID-19 epidemic.  \n>  \n>First, hydroxychloroquine (aka Plaquenil).  \n>  \n>My first sub-point is the flawed nature of the data:  \n>  \n>I\u2019ve attached [an article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354220301145) from the latest issue of Antiviral Research detailing the history of Plaquenil as an antiviral. In short, it\u2019s shown *in vitro/ex\u00a0vivo*\u00a0activity against a ton of viruses (SARS-CoV aka the OG SARS, human coronavirus OC43, enterovirus EV-A71, Zika virus, flu A H5N1 aka bird flu, ebolavirus, HIV) but hasn\u2019t panned out *in vivo*\u00a0in **any**\u00a0of them. In chikungunya, it showed promising *in vitro*\u00a0activity but actually made patients *worse*\u00a0when they actually used it. If it works in COVID-19 against SARS-CoV-2, it\u2019ll be the first time it\u2019s actually worked out.  \n>  \n>Additionally, while Gao et al. talked about great results, they didn\u2019t provide data to back it up. I\u2019m not clear on why this is, but the reports of government censorship early in the outbreak are of course concerning in this setting.  \n>  \n>I\u2019ve also attached the [French study on Plaquenil +/- azithromycin](https://www.mediterranee-infection.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Hydroxychloroquine_final_DOI_IJAA.pdf). As far as I can find out (too many google results for \"COVID-19 hydroxychloroquine study\u201d right now), this is the study that most media outlets are citing regarding the effectiveness of Plaquenil. Unfortunately, instead of a double-blind randomized controlled trial looking at good primary outcomes (i.e does it help you not die from COVID-19), it was an unblinded non-randomized poorly-controlled trial that looked at a surrogate marker (how long for NP swabs, which vary greatly in quality by collection technique, go from PCR-positive to PCR-negative, which doesn\u2019t address whether or not someone is a) better or b) still infectious). While the data on this surrogate outcome looks great and makes for a pretty graph, one of the patients in the treatment group *died*\u00a0(and was subsequently removed from analysis, which is a great way to buff your numbers) while there\u2019s no mention of any of the controls dying.  \n>  \n>There are a number of problems with the design. It\u2019s a small trial (which does help speed up publication but limits the power of the statistics). It\u2019s non-randomized, which introduces all kinds of biases (i.e. sicker patients may be more likely to say \u201cyes, put me on the malaria drug that might kill me if I get too much of it\u201d, or maybe they\u2019re more likely to decline in favor of proven treatments). It\u2019s not blinded; this is *less*\u00a0of an issue when you\u2019re looking at a hard outcome, but the next problem is that they chose time to PCR negativity on NP swabs; if you don\u2019t do an NP swab properly, it increases the likelihood that it\u2019ll be falsely negative. Besides, PCR positivity means only that there\u2019s bits and pieces of virus floating around; distinguishing it from active disease and from infectivity is one of the quandaries of management for this disease right now. The control methodology is terrible: they just pick patients who refuse the experimental treatment (or can\u2019t get it for other reasons) as controls, which gets into the randomization issues I mentioned above.  \n>  \n>My second sub-point is the risk of hyping Plaquenil as a \u201ccure\u201d or \u201ctreatment\u201d for COVID-19.  \n>  \n>First off, there\u2019s a limited supply of it in the country. We\u2019re already seeing a run on supplies as people get tired of hoarding toilet paper and search for the next shiny object to panic-buy. This means that a bunch of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, Lupus, Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s, sarcoidosis, dermatomyositis, and, lest we forget, *malaria*, are\u00a0suddenly unable to obtain necessary medication, all for the cause of assuaging people\u2019s fears based on shaky data.  \n>  \n>Second, Plaquenil is a potentially nasty drug. It can cause all manner of unpleasant side effects (blindness, liver failure, bone marrow failure, nerve failure, angioedema), including QT prolongation with subsequent arrhythmia and death. For those who are getting their psychiatrists to write them for 100 tabs (and yes, things like this is being reported by pharmacies across the country), they stand a chance of dying from the known side effects of a medication with essentially-unknown efficacy. For those who are actually admitted, it\u2019s worth remembering that, if you live through the awful viral pneumonia, you stand a fair chance of dying from acute-onset cardiomyopathy (we\u2019re not yet sure if it\u2019s viral or stress-induced). We\u2019ve now got a political push for physicians to use this relatively-unproven drug on patients who are at a high risk to die from known side effects. That doesn\u2019t help their clinical decision-making.  \n>  \n>My second main point regards azithromycin. This one will be shorter. In brief, azithromycin is a valuable antibiotic for certain specific infections, but because it\u2019s well-marketed as the easy-to-prescribe \u201cZithromax Z-Pak\u201d, it\u2019s often thrown inappropriately at all manner of things that it shouldn\u2019t be used against (viral bronchitis, viral sinusitis, viral nasopharyngitis, etc.). There\u2019s already concern about bugs developing resistance to it (for example, chlamydial urethritis i.e. the most common bacterial STI is very effectively killed off by it, except for the terrifying resistant-to-everything versions that are developing in regions of the world where you can just buy azithromycin OTC). We aren\u2019t helping our battle against atypical pneumonia and other specific infections where azithro works great by suddenly shotgunning it at a bunch of people who are going to get SARS-CoV-2. Also, it too prolongs the QT interval, further increasing the risk of sudden cardiac death. And, as with Plaquenil, I\u2019m having trouble finding any good studies that support its broad usage in COVID-19.  \n>  \n>While I greatly wish that we had an effective antiviral for COVID-19, we as-of-yet don\u2019t. Fast-tracking approval of these 2 meds with no good data to back their use has the potential to do a lot more harm than good. I\u2019d rather see our government stop trying to cut NIH funding so that we can develop effective meds *before*\u00a0we\u00a0have pandemics instead of reflexively making emotionally-driven bad decisions in the face of crisis. We\u2019ve known about bad zoonotic coronaviruses for decades, but we haven\u2019t put money into efforts to stop them until now. Hopefully we can learn from that mistake now that this third coronavirus-driven epi/pandemic is threatening countless lives.",

    "text": "Came across something interesting over the last couple days starting fellowship, and figured I'd share a brief review as I understand it after a couple hours of reading as there is a patient that is being considered for such therapy.\n\nAntibiotic resistance is a hot topic. One approach that has been considered is bacteriophage therapy, which traditionally has not been a part of Western medicine. A lot the research has, to my knowledge, largely been relegated to the Eastern Bloc and was thought to be \"Commie Medicine.\" However, recently USCD has opened the Center for Innovative  Phage Applications and Therapeutics ([https://medschool.ucsd.edu/som/medicine/divisions/infectious-diseases/research/center-innovative-phage-applications-and-therapeutics/Pages/default.aspx](https://medschool.ucsd.edu/som/medicine/divisions/infectious-diseases/research/center-innovative-phage-applications-and-therapeutics/Pages/default.aspx)). They are working with a company called Adaptive Phage Therapeutics or APT ([http://www.aphage.com/](http://www.aphage.com/)). Interestingly enough, a large number of the phages in their phage library have come from the US Navy, who apparently have a huge library of viruses (vira?) at Fort Detrick in Maryland. There is also a group of researchers at Texas A&M working, as well as another company called Ampliphi Biosciences (where do they get these names?).\n\nAt present, phage therapy is currently available! However, an Emergency Investigational New Drug application to the FDA is required for each use, along with evaluation from the IPATH researchers. Moreover, preparation takes 4-6 weeks. As such, this treatment is largely limited to chronic, multi-drug resistant infections with an indolent course most likely in immunosuppressed patients such as transplant recipients or those with cystic fibrosis. Bacterial samples are sent and tested with various phages, and then a cocktail (or multiple cocktails) of phages are given over a prolonged course - although the methodology remains experimental. In one paper regarding an immunocompetent patient, it was shown that the phages were cleared from the serum in minutes ([Open Forum Infect Dis.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29687015#) 2018 Mar 23;5(4):ofy064. doi: 10.1093/ofid/ofy064. eCollection 2018 Apr.).\n\nAs to whether it works, the \"N\" for UCSD appears to be 6, and from what I've gathered they count 5 as successes. The first patients was a professor of psychiatry who had a life-threatening abdominal infection with a resistant strain of *Acinetobacter baumanii* obtained from Egypt, and despite a nadir of 3 pressors in the ICU, has made a full recovery. There are thusfar no reported adverse effects of phage therapy. Case reports have tried to follow endotoxin levels released by lysing bacteria as the most likely source of toxicity, but it has not yet been identified as contributory.\n\nIt is worth noting that phage therapy at this time is adjunctive to antibiotics, and not independent of it. Over time, the MDR bacteria do develop resistance to the phages, although this appears to come at a cost which improves the efficacy of antibiotics and reduces the overall fitness of the bacterium in question.",

    "text": "After looking at the Depression thread from yesterday, I was wondering about the effects of placebo. I read this paper a while ago, [Is the Placebo Powerless? \u2014 An Analysis of Clinical Trials Comparing Placebo with No Treatment](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM200105243442106) which compared differences in 3-arm studies of experimental, placebo and no treatment and concluded that placebo had no powerful clinical effects after comparing response between placebo and no treatment in over 100 studies. \n\nI recently learned that this study was followed up by a [systematic review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15257721) and then a [cochrane review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20091554). The cochrane review found that in patient-reported outcomes, pain and nausea could be influenced by placebo. They wrote that depression was not significantly impacted by placebo which, I was surprised by. \n\nIt seems from these studies that placebo does not matter, but I always hear about placebo in both layperson and medical lit. Am I missing something here? \n",

Placebo is the absence of an intervention and the placebo effect is a sum of all intangible effects on a study individual under artificial circumstances. Study participants are not \"out in the wild\" as any other random patient would be. They are in a study. They are informed of the study, and there are subtle changes to things like behavior, expectations, and reporting that occur with people who are in studies. There's no study that we can do where we can say 100% that the presence of an investigation/investigators has no impact on the outcome. Therefore while controlling for everything else that we can, changes in the outcome are attributed to placebo. \n\nPeople conflate this concept to say that the \"mind has power over the body\" and that there is some powerful therapeutic mechanism to placebo. There is not. If you were to try to utilize the placebo effect therapeutically you would see minor changes particularly in subjective endpoints without any meaningful changes in important outcomes.

    "title": "Grief for a lung cancer patient: 1 month later he's seeing a naturopath",
    "text": "I recently submitted my thoughts and deeply appreciated all of your replies regarding a patient in whom I found metastatic lung cancer. ( link https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/42vaza/currently_grieving_for_a_patient/ ) It has been a difficult, denial filled month for him. Since he and I talked, I have ordered more advanced imaging and consulted more sub-specialists than I had in the previous six months. He has had a \n\n> CT of his chest (7cm spiculated mass)\n\n> CT guided biopsy (likely adenocarcinoma)\n\n> bronchoscopy (metastatic contralateral and ipsilateral lymph nodes)\n\n> brain MRI (2mm and 7mm suspicious lesions)\n\n> PET scan (confirms likely brain metastases)\n\n> multiple oncology and thoracic surgery consults\n\nHe is Stage IV, his chances for cure are zero as I understand them. The struggle is getting him and his family to understand this. I had a difficult conversation with him about a week ago in which we discussed what his staging truly meant. He and his family are in denial about his prognosis. They want second opinions, they are angry, they want a miracle cure.\n\nI know I am taking this too personally because five years ago, I watched my child's godfather die from this same disease. It was found at Stage IIIa, he was treated up until the point when they found mets in his brain. Then he, his family and his oncologist decided together it was time to hang it up, get him comfortable at home, and take a more palliative approach. He died at home, surrounded by his wife of 50 years, his children, grandchildren, and godchildren. I want this for my patient, if it is possible, but I worry that it will not happen now.\n\nUnfortunately when he and I talked about the option of \"doing nothing\" (his words, not mine), he took that to mean I thought there was a chance for a spontaneous remission. He thought getting no treatment meant that it could cure itself, whereas I meant to offer the option of no treatment beyond palliative care as a way to increase the quality of his remaining days while sacrificing some of the quantity. Instead of seeing palliative care or getting a second opinion, he has decided to see a naturopath. I don't know what it is they promised him, whether it was a better diet, less free radicals, chelating his cancer away...I dunno. But I worry that he has sacrificed both the quality AND the quantity of his days by ignoring both his oncologist and me. \n\nI am frustrated. I am frustrated by his oncologist who seemed to dismiss the thought of early palliative care consult in favor of aggressive experimental treatment. I am frustrated with myself because I could have worded my advice about quality of days vs quantity of days better. I am frustrated with the patient for being in denial. And I am frustrated that there is a naturopath vulture out there who is willing to lie to him and tell him there is a cure through tinctures and balms. \n\nI welcome your thoughts, as always. ",

His skin subsequently began deteriorating due to an unknown and unidentifiable cause that resisted numerous forms of treatment. \n            \nIn this scenario I wonder if the traditional differential approach is flawed and another approach might be more fruitful. My thoughts are that an experimental/hypothesis testing approach would be more successful at eliciting the nature of the disease (i.e. what causes it to spread, what physical/biological compounds are causing the disease). I wanted to ask: what questions this group would ask that would be useful in determining the underlying cause of the pathology? I know most of the history is not given, but i'm curious to \"flesh\" out an approach that would allow us to solve medical mysteries that don't fit within the corpus of known medical diseases. ",

    "text": "For context, Nancy is a patient the author discussed previously who had been diagnosed with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. She went through all the usual treatments in an attempt for cure and eventually just to remain alive a little bit longer. She then resorted to experimental, alternative and, at the end like so many, radical attempts to remain alive.\n\n>*For Nancy, death threatened all that she knew as valuable and important, and at the same time, death also brought directly into focus the value and importance of living. Modern medicine, I submit, has failed to respond to this dialectic of life and death in an adequate manner, and its response leads to lives worse than death in the technological manipulation of the dying. In viewing death exclusively as the destruction of meaning, medicine has aimed to do more than alleviate suffering: without realizing it, medicine hides death with technology and dissolves death in discourses. In short, medicine seeks to remove death\u2019s sting from the human community. Yet, like comedic heroes of literary tales, medicine comes along to stop suffering, to help, to bring a little relief, only to make things worse by begetting more and more dehumanization through its technological and psychosocial fixes.*\n\nPreviously, in relating Nancy's story, Bishop observes:\n\n>*Thus, death would threaten to take her away from her daughter; death would focus her on staying alive for her daughter. Death would take away all that was important to her, yet all that was important to her came into relief because death was on the immediate horizon. Can medicine with its \"fixes\" envision death as both destructive of meaning and conducive to it? Can medicine with its \"fixes\" really manage patients in a way that does not do violence to those things held most sacredly, values that come most clearly into relief in and through the clarity provided by the threat of death? Can a kinder, gentler medicine - a sensitive, caring, biopsychosocial medicine, even a spiritualized medicine (or is it medicalized spirituality?) - act as a counterweight to the coldness of technological cures? Does the mere presence of a biopsychosocial medicine bring back the humanity that is lost when technologies are deployed? If we believe that such a medicine - call it a biopsychosociospiritual medicine - is possible, why is it that so often patients find themselves faced with a medicine striving to give them life, only to find it a demeaning experience in their deaths?*\n\n- J.P. Bishop, [*The Anticipatory Corpse*](http://www.amazon.com/The-Anticipatory-Corpse-Medicine-Studies/dp/0268022275/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1363459678&sr=8-1&keywords=anticipatory+corpse)",

    "text": "Mods, I don\u2019t know if this breaks any rules, but please strongly consider leaving this up. This is not your prototypical fundraiser\u2013this is one small part of a concerted effort to implore a major U.S. Scleroderma center to conduct a potentially life-saving clinical trial. I tried to contact a couple of mods by messenger to get the green light to post this but haven\u2019t heard anything back, and I\u2019m submitting my letter, research, and petition to Johns Hopkins at the end of this week/beginning of next, so I\u2019d like to amass as many signatures as I can get.\n\nI'm in the process of drawing up a letter, some assorted research, and a petition calling on the Johns Hopkins Scleroderma Center to conduct a large-scale clinical trial of Therapeutic Plasma Exchange for the treatment of systemic sclerosis. I've created a [Change.org](http://Change.org) petition, and I'd love it if you had a look & signed! I'm sincerely hoping that, alongside my carefully-constructed letter and some research, a petition will help the head of the Clinical Trials department see that Scleroderma patients are interested in seeing this treatment break into the mainstream. Please consider taking a look, signing, and sharing to family and friends! If it manages to get a halfway-decent number of signatures, I'll be submitting it alongside my letter & research to my contact at Johns Hopkins.\n\n  \n[https://www.change.org/p/petition-for-a-large-clinical-trial-of-therapeutic-plasma-exchange-for-systemic-sclerosis](https://www.change.org/p/petition-for-a-large-clinical-trial-of-therapeutic-plasma-exchange-for-systemic-sclerosis)",

    "text": "In the spring of 2017 I had just finished an intensive clinical masters program (as a parent in my mid-30s with two young children) and was 8 months into my first job as a licensed professional. I had been skirting burnout during the last few months of my program, and learning a new profession was difficult and stressful, but exciting. Then I started experiencing severe fatigue and a general feeling of being really unwell. It felt like a flu that didn't go away for weeks. I was told it was likely just a viral illness that was hanging on, and to wait it out.\n\nI had been off work for almost a month. Then my legs started feeling weak. I was tripping, had trouble going up and down stairs, etc. Then my arms. I was also having numbness/pins and needles in my hands, feet, and face. When I had to call my spouse to help me out of the bath and I found I couldn't lift my 3-lb kitten, I went to the emergency room. My neuro exam seemed ok. I had pretty severe muscle fatigue, but my reflexes were normal. They did a lumbar puncture, which came back normal. All my labs were normal. But there was enough concern that they admitted me with suspected Guillain-Barre Syndrome. They were also looking at other possibilities like Myasthenia Gravis. That evening, I began coughing when eating and was made NPO. They did a full brain and spine MRI, which was normal. They did an EMG, which apparently confirmed the GB dx and started me on IVIg.   \n  \nThe third day at the hospital was the worst. I couldn't hold a phone to my ear. I was able to walk to the bathroom with a walker and a nurse supporting me, but that was a stretch. I had been on the phone briefing the colleague who was covering for me, and the longer I talked, the more numb my face and hands got. Once I hung up, I felt like I couldn't get enough oxygen. I ended up having an acute episode of hypocalcemia, causing tetany with carpal spasm. My whole body was immobile and numb, and my hands were frozen into claws for maybe 20 minutes to an hour. Later they told me that anxiety had caused me to hyperventilate, leading to this episode, but I don't remember feeling anxious at all until I couldn't breathe. I knew that many people with GB end up on a vent, so I think it's reasonable that feeling unable to breathe might make me anxious. Annoyingly, they called in psych and diagnosed me with anxiety, which I still think is pretty ridiculous.\n\nAfter 5 days of IVIg, I was significantly better and was discharged. My neurologist said I should be totally back to normal within 6 weeks with PT and OT, and the good thing about GB was that it was a one-off disease and they had caught it before it had done permanent damage. She foresaw no long-term effects.  \n  \nI was back to normal within a month, went back to work half-time during July and full-time in  August. Around mid-September the fatigue returned, followed by the weakness and paresthesia. My neurologist denied my experience, saying it hadn't gotten worse and it was just part of recovery. Then one day I got out of bed and my legs collapsed under me. I was off work again. I got another EMG, which was normal. And the neuromuscular specialist who did it reviewed the first EMG in the hospital and questioned my original diagnosis. All my blood work was still normal. I was now in a situation where I was too ill to work, but everyone was telling me I should be fine. I also started having severe IBS symptoms for the first time in my life.\n\nOver the next 6 months, my symptoms slowly improved, and by June of the following year, I was feeling well. During this time, we had started the process of moving from the US to Canada, to be closer to my spouse's family, and in the fall of 2018, we made that move. I began thinking about getting licensed in my profession in Canada and going back to work.\n\nIn the winter of 2019, I crashed again. The fatigue was severe again, but I did not have weakness. I had nausea/IBS again, paresthesias, and now significant pain in the joints of my hands, wrists, feet, and hips. I also had extremely dry eyes, so bad that a regular ophthalmologist referred me to a specialist. I saw a neurologist again. My neuro exam and blood work was normal. My family doctor tried to refer me to rheumatology, but they refused the referral because I did not have any blood markers. Again, after 6-8 months without treatment, I slowly got better.  \n  \nFrom late 2019 until the summer of 2024, I was well. If I started experiencing increased fatigue, I would slow down and rest more, and it would get better. Tingling in my hands and face were another warning sign, but would disappear with rest. We made another move to a different province, I became registered in my profession again, and I slowly, cautiously, began working again part-time.   \n  \nIn 2022, I was diagnosed with autism and ADHD. I came to the realization that throughout my life, neuro-cognitive burnout would lead to physical illness. As a child, even though I loved school and was very social, I knew I needed more rest and more breaks from social interaction than most people. I faked being sick a lot because my parents didn't understand. When I was around 12 I had an extended period of unexplained severe headaches. I had pneumonia a handful of times. I missed a ton of school in 12th grade, when I turned 18 and could excuse myself. In college, I had an extended period of severe fatigue that forced me to withdraw one semester. It was attributed to anemia, but I had been trying to work full-time and take a full-time course load, which, of course, led to burnout.\n\nADHD meds were a game changer for me. Without them, there is no way I would've been able to go back to work at all. In 2023, after a year of working part-time in a job that was easy and non-clinical (and paid peanuts) while taking private clients on the side, I decided to take a clinical job. It was part-time, but at the same time I started getting more referrals for my own private clients, so since last January, I've essentially been working full-time: half in a clinic and half travelling around to community sites. I am considered a specialist in my field and am the only person in my area doing the specific work that I do.\n\nThis job may not seem too grueling, but everyone in my household is AuDHD. My spouse (bless him) has worked full-time the whole 20 years we've been together, but this means he's always overwhelmed and does not have the capacity to do much else. My oldest just finished high-school. He has severe OCD, has experienced horrible trauma in schools that don't understand and can't support him, and finished the last of his work from home. I had to basically drag him, limping, across the finish line. My youngest is in middle school and for the past 3 years has quit attending school around March, when she hits her limit. So the spring was overwhelming and stressful.\n\nWe moved 1500km away from any family to a place where we hoped to buy a house. In the year it took me to become registered in my profession, the average home price in this city (which we moved to because it was still affordable) jumped from $350k to $550k, and interest rates to over 7%. Even if I had been able to sustain full-time work, that prices us out of the market. We are stuck in a rental house that we are incredibly lucky to have, because rental prices have also soared and there is 100% occupancy in this city and families living in tents. Even though our rent is under market, it's still more than we can afford, and our savings, which was supposed to be our down payment, is shrinking. Still, we're lucky to have a place to live and savings at all.\n\nIn June of this year, I started experiencing severe fatigue. My ADHD meds stopped working, suddenly and completely. Then the weakness in my arms and legs returned. It felt exactly like the first episode in 2017. I immediately took 2 weeks off of work and stopped doing anything, hoping that complete rest would head this off. I didn't get better. My eyes got dry again, I started having pain in my thumb and big toe joints and my knees. My head started feeling really heavy. My vision was getting blurry, more sensitive to light, and it was harder to focus my eyes. Then my voice would get rough when I was really tired and I started coughing a lot first thing in the morning and when I ate or drank. \n\nThinking I might be aspirating, I went to the emergency room. Based on my history and presenting symptoms, they suspected myasthenia gravis. They did a neuro exam, blood work, chest x-ray and CT. After neuro saw me, they were fairly confident it was MG and laid out a treatment plan with a trial of Mestinon. A modified barium swallow study showed that I was not aspirating, but I was having significant silent reflux, which explained my coughing and rough voice. I got in for an EMG quickly, and they did an extensive repetitive muscle stimulation test. It was normal. The neuro team completely back-tracked, ordered rheumatological blood work, and referred me back to my family doctor. When I asked what the plan was, 5 doctors stood there and stared at me. The neuro attending said something about fibromyalgia, which made me want to throw something at her. When I brought up the fact that I am too ill to work and asked what kind of doctor sees patients like me after neuro clears them, she mumbled something about rheumatology, knowing full well that I will never meet the requirements for a rheumatology referral in this province (or many others). They discharged me with a prescription for reflux medication.\n\nI saw my family doctor 2 weeks later, and all she did was recommend PT and CBT. When I said that IVIg worked for me before, and could that be justification for trying it again, she said there's no way it would be approved. She said that autoimmune diseases \"virtually always\" show up in labs, which I know is complete bullshit.\n\nI am sad, and frustrated, and not sure what to do now. I have a bunch of unfinished paperwork, which makes me look unprofessional, but I don't have the focus or cognitive stamina to get through it. My aunt wants me to fly to the US to see my uncle's naturopath, and I was referred to a naturopath here as well, but I don't feel safe going to either. The one in the US sounds like a charlatan, from what I know. And the one here (recommended by my son's therapist, who I have so much trust in) I found out is a DAN (Defeat Autism Now) \"doctor,\" which screams red flags all over. And I've fallen into the rabbit hole of alternative medicine before, which is not emotionally or psychologically healthy for me. I have bordered on orthorexia in the past. These things become all-consuming for me.\n\nI need to stop typing, as my arms are shaking. I'm going to reply to my own post later to vent more. I don't expect anyone to have read this far, but it's therapeutic for me, so thank you to any and all of you for this space.",

    "title": "Advice Needed: Best Medical Clinics for Autoimmune Disease.",
    "text": "I started experiencing strange symptoms 3 years ago. All of my symptoms seemed unrelated to my family doctor and I have had all the referrals - urology, pain clinic, psychology, neurology, physical therapy, neuromuscular specialist, etc. Finally, about 6 months ago I was diagnosed with Myasthenias Gravis (MG) based on two physical exams and a positive ACHR blood test. My EMG on my eye was negative but I have struggled with the stereotypical eye droop/double vision. On the day I had the EMG, I was feeling pretty good. I was finally diagnosed my a neuromuscular specialist with MG (mild, general). \n\nI trialed Mestinon for 3 months (60mg / 3x day)and provided zero reprieve, except undesirable side effects (GI). I have often wondered if I have another autoimmune disease because there are so many things not explained by my MG diagnosis: frequent low grade fevers and the worst symptom: muscle pain. I\u2019m at about a 6/10 pain level every day. During a flareup my pain is around a 8-9. This is coming from someone who has broken many bones (accident years ago) and really knows what 10 pain feels like. My family doctor sent me for a bunch of tests related to autoimmune diseases (like ANA) but apparently my blood look looks perfect (other than ACHR) and my doctor has suggested I don\u2019t \u201cgo fishing\u201d for more autoimmune diseases. \n\nI am not getting the medical treatment that I need. I have been brushed off by my neuromuscular specialist as being lucky to be a mild case and am only eligible for treatment (with my insurance) if my mobility gets so bad I need a wheelchair or breathing so bad that I need a breathing tube. My specialist says he won\u2019t prescribe Prednisone unless my symptoms worsen and honest, after all the horror stories I have heard, I would be hesitant to go on it. I have 2 young kids. I do not want this to get worse. \u201cMild MG\u201d is still having a huge impact on my life. I can\u2019t imagine what those of you with more severe cases are going through. \n\nThis is where I am looking for advice\u2026I have some saving stashed away and would be more than willing to spend it on a thorough assessment and treatment. A clinic in North America would be most desirable but I would literally travel across the world if it meant getting the best help. I\u2019ve been listening to Dr. Mark Hymans podcast (UltraWellness Center) and have heard a lot about the Mayo Clinic as being the gold standard for a thorough assessment and up-to-date treatment. However, my internet research is mostly leaving me overwhelmed.\n\nAny recommendations on health care clinics or specialists I could go to? \nI have some savings to spend on my health but I don\u2019t have endless funds.

My primary care told me it\u2019s mental and refuses to do tests because I have a documented anxiety/panic attack diagnosis. Psychiatrist says there is nothing they can do beyond the current medication and it sounds physiological. I had the same fight with my primary care over thyroid treatment that I had to enter a clinical trial to prove was right. I\u2019m beside myself and honestly hate feeling this way and having my care providers just keep telling me there\u2019s nothing wrong.

        "text": "So can I ask what makes you think there is an autoimmune issue going on? Have you had any lab work done at all? To \"start a healing process\" you need to know what's going on first. These symptoms alone could be any number of things and might not even be related to one another. So to start what you need to do is bring up these symptoms to a PCP and have them do a workup.\n\nDid they actually straight out refuse testing because you have a mental health diagnosis, or did they explain how these symptoms are more likely due to an existing condition, side effect of a medication, etc? If it's the former, get a new doctor. That's really your only option. The thing is, these are common anxiety symptoms too. That's not to say if one has these symptoms it's anxiety and nothing else can be wrong. But if someone has anxiety *and* you rule out other potential causes, it's an understandable next thought. I say this too as someone with anxiety myself. I used to have serious flushing all over my body and convinced it was something other than anxiety until I found a medication that fixed the problem. Again, not to say that this is the case for you. \n\nBut ultimately what you need is to confirm what labs are normal/abnormal before you can move forward. So many things can cause these symptoms - something like low blood sugar can cause sweating/shaking, for one example. If you're seeing an endo for thyroid stuff, it might be worth mentioning to them as these symptoms can sometimes correlate with hormonal issues. Overactive thyroid is another possibility if the labs suggest it.",

    "text": "I'm a moderator of r/HerpesCureResearch\n\nThe pharmaceutical company AiCuris has asked us to connect to possible candidates for their clinical trial.\n\nThey are running a **Phase III trial on the efficacy and safety of Pritelivir, a viral enzyme inhibitor for Herpes Simplex Infections**.\n\nIn previous trials Pritelivir has shown higher efficacy than the approved medications Acyclovir and Valacyclovir, and it is effective also against strains that are resistant to the available medications.\n\nThe clinical trial is restricted to patients that have a higher need for a better medication; in particular to patients that suffer from an immunocompromised condition.\n\nThe **clinical trial of Pritelivir** accepts people that:\n\n\\- **have a HSV infection that is susceptible to acyclovir** (= it can be treated with acyclovir) or resistant to acyclovir\n\n\\- **are immunocompromised**. This definition includes many health conditions:\n\n\\-- diagnosed with **HIV** (a positive diagnosis is enough)\n\n\\-- or: diagnosed with an **autoimmune condition** (lupus, and many others) that require the use of immunosuppressant drugs\n\n\\-- or: diagnosed with **cancer**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese people might suffer from the most severe outcomes when infected with Herpes Simplex. Therefore if you can, please bring this information to patients / clinics / advocacy groups that might benefit from it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMore informations are available on the website of the clinical trial:\n\n[https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03073967](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03073967) (part E)\n\nand the possibility to take part to the clinical trial can be verified here:\n\n[https://hsv-care.com/](https://hsv-care.com/)\n\nAt  the moment the clinical trial has study centers only in the US, but  they are going to open new centers across many countries in Europe and in China.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you very much for your support!\n\nIf you need further information, don't hesitate to connect with me!",

    "title": "Preventing plaquenil induced retinopathy? (Calling the sciencey folks around)",
    "text": "So I\u2019ve been recently diagnosed with undifferentiated connective tissue disease based on a positive ANA at 1:160 with all three homogenous, clumpy and punctuate nucleolar patterns (who even has that??) and low C3 and total complement levels, along with a myriad of symptoms that started 9 years ago after being massively overmedicated for migraines. \n\nI\u2019ve been given plaquenil, but I must admit I\u2019m a bit scared of the potential retinal toxicity. Is there any measure one could take to limit their chances of developing it? I immediately thought of lutein + zeaxanthin and wondered if they would be beneficial or actually detrimental. There\u2019s virtually nothing about it throughout the internet, [this] (https://books.google.com.br/books?id=C3ceBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA2&lpg=PA2&dq=hydroxychloroquine+zeaxanthin+lutein&source=bl&ots=VNTx58PtTv&sig=ACfU3U0SU7JBiEB6IDSXvoXK44DgSjmFuw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjusrS7i57yAhUbpJUCHWKVC4gQ6AF6BAgNEAI) is really the best I could find. Unfortunately, as a science curious laywoman, I am having a bit of trouble understanding it:\n\n*(Note: 4AQR = hydroxy-/chloroquine retinopathy)*\n\n>Zeaxanthin is the predominant xanthophyll in the center of the macula with lutein rising in relative concentration in the parafovea [7]. The xanthophylls reduce chromatic aberration, absorb damaging blue light, and protect retinal membranes from photooxidation [7, 9]. **The extent of their distribution is similar to the size of the bull\u2019s-eye macular lesion in 4AQR and suggests that they may have a role in toxicity.** \n\nMeaning here is that they should be detrimental, right? I don\u2019t understand what \u201crole in toxicity\u201d they\u2019re implying xanthophylls have. But then they go on to state:\n\n>For example, 4AQR in its advanced stages manifests outer retinal atrophy that **spares the fovea** and is greatest from 2 to 8\u00b0 eccentric to the fovea [10, 11]. **Xanthophylls have their greatest concentrations in the fovea and drop to a lower plateau within 4\u00b0 of the fovea [9].**\n\nIs this implying that zeaxanthin/xanthophylls could protect the fovea from plaquenil-induced damage or facilitate it? I don\u2019t get what they\u2019re trying to say here, the remarks seem to contradict one another. I\u2019ve read that plaquenil has high affinity to melanin and binds to it in the retinal pigment epithelium, bioaccumulating and inducing damage. But could it do the same to macular pigments such as lutein and zeaxanthin?? Can the smarter people out there please chime in? \n\nAlso, [another] (https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/21/14/4994/pdf ) thing I\u2019ve found, this time regarding zinc, but am not sure if a potential benefit of zinc supplementation could be assumed from it:\n\n>*6. Zinc and Autophagy in AMD\n\n>Zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP) is a zinc compound present in trace amounts in red blood cells during heme synthesis (reviewed in [96]). In normal conditions, iron chelates with protoporphyrin, but in iron deficiency or impaired iron metabolism, zinc takes the role of iron, resulting in increased formation of ZPP. We and others have shown that compromised iron metabolism might play a role in AMD pathogenesis [97,98]. Therefore, ZPP may be an element of the involvement of zinc in AMD pathophysiology. Chloroquinone (CQ), a 4-aminoquinoline compound, is commonly used as an antimalarial and anti-inflammatory drug (reviewed in [99]). Although its mechanism of action as a pharmaceutical is not completely known, some of its biological effects may be underlined by inhibition of lysosome functions, which are critical for autophagy [100]. In particular, CQ can inhibit acidification of the lysosome, which is essential for its ability to transport and degrade the cargo via autophagy.\n\nOne last question for those in the know: would this be a drug whose metabolism would be considerably different among men and women and whose clinical trials would have been affected by gender bias? Any reason to believe it would be wise to prescribe lower doses for women?\n\nAnd as a side question, is there anyone here with a similar autoimmune disease presentation to mine and did you find benefit in taking plaquenil?",

When enough of it accumulates over time, it begins to affect vision. One scary thing is because of the very long half life of plaquenil, vision changes can continue worsening even after you stop the drug. The dose toxicity happens at is dependent on weight; for myself, it happened right when it was expected to, which was approximately thirteen years on an average dose of 200mg. The good news is if you get a visual field test every six months, you should catch it before it's too bad. For me, I do notice changes in vision but I'm mostly ok. It's annoying, but I'm nowhere near legally blind. But you are essentially putting your eyes on an ageing fast track. I'm in my early thirties but I probably have the eyes of an old woman now lol.",

Mine tested me for lupus and arthritis via bloodwork and then told me she thinks its psychosomatic in our ONLY conversation. She sent my GP a letter recommending psychological treatment and said my severe iron deficiency is due to periods (i dont have periods).  She also wrote down how she thinks my bloodwork is the consequence of my asthma, and i had asked two pneumologist if thats the case and they said no way.  \n\n\nSo i have a lot of letters from various docs who contradict each other and who dont even listen to my symptoms properly. I had to beg for an EMG with the only doc who is still at my side (neurology), and after finally getting an MRI the radiologist at the clinic did not let me get contrast so i wont even know if i have muscle inflammation or not.

    "title": "Any advice for dealing with severe fatigue as a young adult",
    "text": "Hi all, looking for some advice and maybe clarity if anyone else has experienced similar issues. In September/October of last year, I (then 25F) started experiencing severe fatigue and joint pain/swelling/stiffness. This has become a major barrier to me being able to live my life. My dogs and I had to move back in with my parents after being on my own for 6 years. I barely made it through the end of my masters. My quality of life is diminished and I know my dogs would love to be able to go on more adventures.\n\nThe joint involvement is primarily hands, feet, and neck. I\u2019m no stranger to joint pain as I have hyper mobile EDS. Though this is different and doesn\u2019t come and go with use. Weather/environmental condition changes such as temperature, humidity, and pressure have been observed as a significant factor. In past years I have noticed flares of the joint symptoms but I have always been written off as it being my EDS. \n\nThe severe fatigue is new. I\u2019ve always been really active and this has limited my ability to exercise and to be social. At night, I get my 9-10 hours of good sleep and then on the weekends it\u2019s just like I can\u2019t function. I sleep for the majority of (14-18 hours) at least one weekend day. If you\u2019re familiar with the spoon theory, it\u2019s very accurate to my situation. \n\nMy first rheumatologist was fairly certain that I was dealing with psoriatic arthritis. I\u2019ve been on Otezla now for about 5 months. The pain and stiffness is much better, but the swelling and  fatigue is not improving. I\u2019m having a lot of side effects from the Otezla, nausea and GI upset. My new Rheumatologist is not sure that I have any autoimmune diseases at all, and told me I am a \u201cmedical mystery\u201d. I\u2019m starting to feel super defeated and just overwhelmed by this. \n\nSome additional background info: recent bloodwork results showed positive ANA, 1:80,  but pretty much all other tests were normal. X-rays: all normal. I have a sleep study scheduled out a month or so. I have pitting in most of my nails, redness/flushing/rosacea over my cheeks and nose, and I get mouth sores, not cold sores, with high stress and severe joint flares. A few times a year I will break out in a rash that has previously been incorrectly diagnosed as ringworm and pityriasis rosea. I also have been diagnosed with POTs and have frequent migraines. \n\nAs a young dog mom of two handsome labs, I would really like to be able to function and live as much of a normal life as possible. Doctors are very unsure of how to move forward and what to try. Not looking for a diagnosis, just suggestions on what has been helpful or what to look into from individuals who have been experiencing similar symptoms and issues. TYIA! \n",

    "text": "I was diagnosed with type one diabetes at 3, selective IGA deficiency at like 10, and Hashimoto\u2019s a bit after that (though they say it\u2019s not severe enough to be on medication for, so I\u2019ve never been on/prescribed any.) \n\nAfter I got Covid over 4 years ago, I\u2019ve been *so tired*. All of the time. Especially during the day. No matter how much I sleep, I\u2019m just still tired. Ive slept over 48 hours straight before, I have to take at least one nap a day or I can\u2019t function, and that\u2019s on top of the sleep I already get. I\u2019ve been getting thyroid tests for years, and every time they come back they say \u201cnothing\u2019s wrong\u201d. I\u2019m getting so frustrated.\n\nThe issue is, I\u2019ve already been diagnosed with so much\u2026 mental health wise, as well. I\u2019ve been diagnosed with depression since middle school as well, and I\u2019ve been medicated. I just didn\u2019t used to be this tired. So I\u2019m scared of being labeled as \u2018crazy\u2019, or having people not believe me, or dismiss me. Should I seek a sleep study? Am I crazy? Sorry. I know this isn\u2019t the best place for medical advice. I just don\u2019t have anyone I can ask that I feel won\u2019t judge me. ",

The sleep apnea/narcolepsy test sucks so bad (I\u2019ve done it lol) but at the end of the day it\u2019s not going to hurt you to get it done or involve any unnecessary risks (like more medicine, anaesthesia, radiation, etc). So I\u2019d say pursue it. You never know what the data might show; even if you\u2019re negative for sleep apnea/narcolepsy it may lend some insight on the rest of your conditions. Best of luck!!",

    "text": "These are what the doctor printed out for me on the medication. I have a great doctor. And she is always very upfront with me. We have tried, methotrexate, benlysta,azithrpoine,steroids,and a few others. I am and always have been on hydroxychloroquine.  She did tell me though that I am the first person that she will have is a patient to try this. That she is read amazing studies on it and I do fit the requirements. But that she hates having any of her patients being a first one and especially me since I have a lot of things going on autoimmune wise and in an active flair.\nIf anyone has any advice or has taken this medication before? Can you please let me know how it helps or how it did it. Like the pros and consI guess..\nI'm 36 years old and I have been diagnosed now. For 3 years. They believe I have had it for much longer by looking at my medical history, and all the other medical issues i already have. But for these 3 years, I have only had a moment of relief with azitheropine for a bit until it wasn't safe to take anymore. Other than that, I feel like nothing has worked. And nothing will. But now like I just told the doctor.(I'm typing this in the parking lot) I feel like there is no options for me. And like I told her my mental health is more important to me than my physical health. But my physical health has now gotten to the point where I can't do the things I love to do or need to do. And that in itself is starting to tear down what's left of my mental health. For me is the main problem. I don't know if anyone else feels like that. But yeah.  \n\nSorry for the extra rant.\nLooking forward to reading any info you all can provide.\n\nSending postive vibes to everyone \u2728\ufe0f \ud83d\udc9b \ud83d\udc93",

    "text": "22F here. Advice/venting lol. Undiagnosed, have 3 months to go till my rheumatology appointment. I was hoping to get some insight on my symptoms and advice to see if I\u2019m documenting enough for my appointment. Not looking for a diagnosis but I\u2019ve been leaning towards emphazing lupus at the appointment so if you have experience that this may lead to me to a different autoimmune disease I\u2019d be happy to hear about that. \nI have terrible anxiety please be kind<3\n\nFor some context, I was a foster-adopt kid who went through a lotttt (I read a whole medical study on the connection between autoimmune disease and childhood trauma, does anybody else feel there\u2019s validity to this?) I\u2019ve spent years forcing myself to go to urgent cares and hospitals when my symptoms get too bad to function only to be told it\u2019s a sinus infection or eat a banana and F off. I was a super active kid I did ballet and other dance for over 10years so it feels like I\u2019m practically a vegetable compared to how I used to be. I feel like I\u2019m in the body of an 80 year old and ibuprofen doesn\u2019t help. In the morning I can\u2019t even stretch a little without my muscles cramping up. Admittedly I only get relief with thc/cbd products. my knees swell often with a little exercise and my last hospital trip was because I was at work and my arm went numb (hasn\u2019t gone back to normal since) and I was having chest pains. I have a low grade fever, night sweats, raynauds since I was a child, and i get rashes all over my body either from sunlight, water, heat/exercise, and stress. A light pinkish red rash has started to appear in that butterfly rash area within just the last couple days for the first time but I\u2019m unsure if it\u2019s a butterfly rash or just a random one. Last year I started getting back to back UTIs which I never had issues with before. And the fatigue is no joke. No amount of napping could save me. Every day I run on fumes. I had to quit the job I was at before this one and didn\u2019t work for 5 months due to a bad flare up of my symptoms probably sparked by covid. Basically, I\u2019d like to maximize my time with the rheumatologist and be as prepared as I can because I\u2019ve already been dealing with the majority of my symptoms for at least 6 years. Also being biracial makes it harder for me to identify things compared to all the pictures of fair skinned people. I\u2019ve attached all my notes and some of my documentation of symptoms\u2026..am I on the right track? How much do they take symptoms into account for diagnosis? I know blood tests seem to be the determining factor but all my usual labs from urgent cares and hospitals always come back normal so\u2026I\u2019m worried\ud83d\ude05",

    "text": "24yo, F\n\nI\u2019ll spare the long story because this will be long anyway, but my whole journey of feeling symptoms and trying to figure out what\u2019s going on started back in 2018 and is still ongoing. Over the course of these past 5 years, i\u2019ve seen my regular family doctor, allergists, dermatologists, and psychiatrists, i\u2019ve tried different ointments, creams, otc supplements, and oral medications. I\u2019ve kept food journals, sleep journals, symptom logs, etc. and cannot pinpoint any specific reason for what\u2019s going on with me.\n\nThe symptoms I feel will go away for several months or so but then randomly come back. When they flare up sometimes I notice one first and the others trickle in within a week or two, but sometimes multiple will hit me at once. \n\nMy symptoms:\n\nFatigue -this one is so frustrating because I feel like my friends/family/dr don\u2019t understand how bad it is. I\u2019m not just sleepy, i\u2019m not lazy, and I genuinely am not being dramatic. \n\nSkin rashes -i\u2019ve always had eczema, but in 2018 I had a flare up unlike any other I\u2019d had and it\u2019s become a new normal. Until then my problem areas were the inside of my elbows, arms, and backs of thighs. 2018-Now my flare ups consist of red, dry, flaky, swollen eyelids and around eyes, my scalp, my lips become a weird texture that\u2019s not necessarily dry, but uncomfortable and takes months to go away, and then the regular red, itchy, dry patches on my lower cheeks/jawline, and front of neck.\n\nJoint pain -fingers, neck, shoulders, jaw, lower back, knees\n\nMuscle weakness -arms and legs\n\nSlight shortness of breath -but i\u2019ve always had asthma and what I feel now is not as bad as my asthma will get\n\nBrain fog\nNight sweats\nNausea\n\nOther things to note that may/may not be related:\nI\u2019ve been diagnosed with adhd, depression, and anxiety and have been taking medication for these since 2020. At first I thought these may have been the cause of my fatigue and brain fog, but i\u2019ve tried out several different meds and have only had improvement with the depression, anxiety, and adhd alone, the fatigue and fog have stayed. \n\nMy most recent blood tests don\u2019t show anything of major concern, but my dr does want to do more studies and i\u2019ll be following up soon. \nEverything on my tests is normal aside from the following which have shown up on this round of testing as well as when I was tested about a year ago:\n\nAll of these are \u201cout of reference range\u201d but none are \u201ccritically\u201d Low/High\n\nMCHC     -Low \n\nEos          -High\n\nChloride  -High\n\nALT(SGPT) -Low\n\nVitamin D  -Low\n\nANA    -Positive Abnormal \n            -Homogeneous Pattern  1:640\n\nAnti-Centromere B Antibodies   -High\n\n\nI\u2019m not looking for anyone here to try to diagnose or anything like that, I know only a medical professional can do that!\n\nI am just tired of feeling this way. Sometimes I question myself thinking i\u2019m just being dramatic or I just need to sleep more or eat better or exercise more etc, but then the symptoms will get really bad at the most random times and i\u2019m thinking maybe i\u2019m not being dramatic enough and that i\u2019ve grown tolerant to feeling shitty and am not giving myself enough credit.\nIt\u2019s especially confusing because i\u2019ve always thought I have a high pain/discomfort tolerance and feel like I know my body well so then I can\u2019t just be being dramatic right? \n\u2026.but then why can\u2019t anyone find anything wrong with me?\n\nMy partner and I often times get the same amount of sleep, eat/drink the same, and do the same exact things throughout the day - we\u2019re the same weight, height, and i\u2019m even a few years younger yet she has so much more energy and feels healthy and fine. \n\nMy doctor says it could be lupus, but then my anti-dsdna test is negative and my skin rash isn\u2019t an obvious malar rash so aside from my positive homogenous ANA and what I feel there\u2019s not really enough evidence to send me to a rheumatologist. \n\nI guess i\u2019m just asking if anyone can relate? \nI feel so misunderstood and invalidated and am almost to the point of telling myself i\u2019m fine and need to just put up with it.",

    "text": "So I\u2019m on the search for answers right now and I\u2019m just so scared I\u2019m not going to get them, so I decided to post here and just see if anyone has any similar experiences.\n\nTo cut a very long story short\u2026\nJanuary 2021 working in a covid test site (didn\u2019t catch covid, 100% sure of this with the amount of tests I had to do in this job) I developed a ganglion on the dorsal side of my left wrist and pain in my left wrist. Telephone consultation diagnosed tendonitis, suggested rest and strengthening exercises. Didn\u2019t help.\n\nSummer 2021 had an ultrasound to check for tendonitis, no evidence of it. Referred to orthopaedics. Had an X-ray, nerve induction study (had been getting tingling down pinky and ring finger) and MRI, all came back clear. Suggested ganglion was possibly slipping into joint and causing all my issues. Had a steroid injection and they attempted to drain the cyst, had pain relief for about 4 months.\n\nEnd of 2021 started referral process again for another steroid injection. \n\nApril 2022 I lost my laboratory job temporarily and ended up working in manual labour for about 2.5 months, started getting worse symptoms in my left wrist (weakness, numbness, tingling, hard to grip and carry things) and now for the first time started getting symptoms in my right.\n\nJuly 2022 saw orthopaedics again (different consultant), decided to investigate rather than doing steroid injection. Ultrasound showed thickening lining of wrist capsule (he said if he saw it on a 70 year old woman he wouldn\u2019t be concerned, but then wrote \u201cmild\u201d on all paperwork?) and mild increase in blood flow under Doppler in wrist and knuckles. Went for a MRI which was compeltely normal, did the ultrasound again and could still see the issue. He even showed me what his normal wrist looked like in comparison to mine (I\u2019m a biologist so have a small understanding of medical bits and bobs). \n\nDecember 2022 Had a steroid injection into both wrists and was referred to rheumatology with him saying \u201cI can\u2019t rule in but I can\u2019t rule out the possibility of something like RA\u201d. Steroid injection offered no relief.\n\nFast forward to now and I\u2019ve finally got to see a rheumatologist. He\u2019s examined my hands and feet in a consultation, heard the majority of my medical history but I forgot to mention a few bits, sent me for, I quote, \u201cblood tests for every autoimmune condition including rheumatoid arthritis and lupus\u201d and X-rays. I\u2019ve had an ultrasound done this week which I watched and chatted to the doctor while she did it and I couldn\u2019t really see the issues seen on scan before, she also commented that there was no evidence of bone breakdown to suggest RA. \n\nSo basically I\u2019m now convinced I\u2019m going to get either no diagnosis or a diagnosis of fibromyalgia. And I\u2019m just a bit scared.\n\nOther symptoms \n- \u201cflares\u201d with increased severe pain, fatigue, general malaise, headache, bone pain, feeling of muscle twitching and skin. I was brought to tears the other night with how much pain my entire legs were in.\n- Migraine - I\u2019ve suffered with migraines and chronic migraines for years. I have a permanent low level headache\n- Low back pain\n- Shoulder and next pain\n- Costochondritis \n- Brain fog\n- Frequent infections - once I get sick the first time in winter, I\u2019ll be sick permanently for months. I\u2019ve had flu the past 3 years running, chronic sinusitis, possible whooping cough, pilonidal cyst, conjunctivitis, ear infection, constant colds.\n\nSound like anyone here? Now the possibility of RA seems to have gone out the window unless my bloods come back positive, I\u2019m so worried I\u2019ll get no diagnosis or a fibro diagnosis\u2026",

I eventually learned to manage the prednisone effects but no thanks to my treatment team. My research indicated that people have huge difficulties coping with this level of prednisone. One study indicated that about 20% of people on 80mmg or more per day are subsequently and for the first time \"diagnosed\" with a major psychiatric illness (e.g. psychosis, bipolar). That is, people are diagnosed and treated for a psych disorder with the most powerful antipsychotic drugs when the nature of the \"disorder\" is iatrogenic, i.e the prescribed medicine for another disorder. What I find utterly irresponsible is that the treatment team offered zero patient education on how to manage the well-known consequences of large dose prednisone. Does anyone know of a good patient education resource for high-dose prednisone?",

    "text": "I (30 F) am at my wit\u2019s end. I have been dealing with severe pain for almost 15 years when moving or using limbs. I first noticed pain in my feet that traveled up to my calf area when I was walking around campus. It made my feet feel tired and like my feet were \u201clocked\u201d up. It would subside once I was able to sit down. It never went away and I just kind of got used to it. I saw a doctor who said it may be gout as my uric acid was raised by about .5 and was prescribed medication for that. I took it for about three months and it did absolutely nothing. She said it must not have been gout and took me off the medication, told me to exercise more and take aleve as needed. Fast forward to about three years ago and I noticed a similar feeling in my arms, wrists, and hands. They get very worn out from typing or holding a phone. The foot pain has gotten more severe and is causing me to trip and fall. I have also started walking on the outside of my feet. I saw a podiatrist this June who thought I had CMT disease and had an EMG/NCV scheduled at a neurologist. They also prescribed some custom insoles and gave me braces to wear if walking so I don\u2019t break an ankle and to add support.\n\nEMG/NCV findings:\n\nNCV FINDINGS:\n\n-Evaluation of the left Fibular motor nerve showed prolonged distal onset latency (6.9 ms) and decreased conduction velocity (Poplt-B Fib, 39 m/s).\n\n-The left median motor nerve showed reduced amplitude (4.1 mV).\n\n-The left ulnar motor nerve showed decreased conduction velocity (B Elbow-Wrist, 47 m/s).\n\n-The left median sensory nerve showed prolonged distal peak latency (3.8 ms).\n\n-All remaining nerves (as indicated in the following tables) were within normal limits.\n\n-All F Wave latencies were within normal limits.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0EMG FINDINGS:\n\n-Needle evaluation of the left anterior tibialis, the left gastroc, the left Fibularis Long, the left biceps femoris (long head), the left vastus medialis, the left deltoid, the left triceps, the left biceps, the left pronator teres, the left flexor carpi ulnaris, the left first dorsal interosseous, and the left abductor pollicis brevis muscles showed increased motor unit amplitude, diminished recruitment, and decreased interference pattern.\n\n-All remaining muscles (as indicated in the following table) showed no evidence of electrical instability.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nConclusion: This study showed neurophysiologic evidence of a distal symmetrical sensorimotor polyneuropathy of the L UE and LE with features of axonal loss.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe was not sure what caused this and referred me to a muscular neurologist. She didn\u2019t think it was CMT and did blood tests. She said it was probably an autoimmune disease.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBlood Test Results:\n\nAbnormal:\n\nC4 Complement: 50 mg/dL [13-36 mg/dL]\n\nC3 Complement: 188 mg/dL [84-166 mg/dL]\n\nCRP: 25.0 mg/L [<=8.0 mg/L]\n\nESR: 45 mm/hr [<20 mm/hr]\n\nAlbumin Electrophoresis: 3.5 g/dL [3.6-4.7 g/dL]\n\nAlpha 2 Globulin Electrophoresis 1.0 g/dL [0.5-0.9 g/dL]\n\nBloodwork that was normal standards:\n\nSSB (LA) (ENA) ANTIBODY, IGG (SO)\n\nSSA 52 AND 60 (RO) (ENA) ANTIBODIES, IGG (SO)\n\nANCA VASCULITIS PROFILE (SO)\n\nANA WITH HEP-2 SUBSTRATE, IGG BY IFA (SO)\n\nHEAVY METALS PANEL 3, BLOOD (ARSENIC, MERCURY, LEAD)\n\nT4 FREE\n\nTSH\n\nVITAMIN B12\n\nHEMOGLOBIN A1C\n\nSorry for the long read. I am just super frustrated and sick of not knowing what is wrong. I am in excruciating pain and have gained weight because it hurts so bad to exercise. I also don\u2019t want to exacerbate something because I don\u2019t know what is wrong. I feel like doctors know something is wrong but they aren\u2019t sure what so they kind of just keep passing me along. I am just wondering if anyone here has any ideas or something to look into.",

While Rheumatology oversees my care at this point, it was the findings of all the other specialist that made up a huge part of my dx by rheumatology. Also specific systemic complications like my inner ear disease, and all the complications with aseptic peritonitis my care is STILL under those specialists.

Now bedridden 1.5mos stuck in a severe flare. Can\u2019t work = can\u2019t pay bills = can\u2019t take care of kiddo. Out of time, hope, and ideas.\n\nBACKGROUND: \n35yo F, 10yr+ journey to reaching a diagnosis w/ suspected AI disease, historically seronegative. Past MDs suspected SLE or RA, EDS. Shitty HDHP ins covg hindered my ability to see specialists consistently, hard to establish baselines, be seen during active flares, etc. My health has severely declined esp past yr to the point where I\u2019m mostly bedridden, can\u2019t work, dibilitating pain, daily subluxations/injuries from basic house chores, history of fractures, muscle & lig tears from simply existing upright lol, frequent infections, usu need steroids to recover from simple colds/sinus infection\u2026 (just had another bad case of Covid- 3rd time in 4.5 mos, despite vaxxed/boosted.) Frequent \u201cauto immune flares\u201d.\n\nList of symptoms and weird medical issues/incidents/hospitalizations is LONG\u2026 happy to share all, but some dx: CFS, Fibromyalgia, IBS, FVL, TGN, Occip. Neuralgia, periph. neuropathy, Reynauds, Erythromelalgia, eczema, much more.  Referred for EDS genetic. testing. Mom has mult. AI diseases, more in fam hist.. Moved OOS 1yr ago- starting fresh w new MDs has been exhausting\u2026 So scared I will not get answers/treatment plan. \n\nThere HAS to be a way to narrow this down. I really feel like pts who don\u2019t meet textbook dx are so neglected. As a former nursing student, I am certain if an experienced, thorough MD took the time to treat this like the pathology case studies we had in school, they\u2019d reach a dx. I have PLENTY of clinical history/presentations to work with beyond \u201cfatigue and polyarthralgia\u201d. Im writing a comprehensive journal of my med history, symptoms, issues, hospitalizations, dx, photos of any physical presentations of over last 13yrs in hopes it will help. \n\nLABS RUN/RESULTS:\nABNORMAL: vit D (defic), ANA Multiplex Screen w Reflex (SS-B positive, others neg) \n\nNORMAL RANGE/NEGATIVE: Ferritin, CK, C Reactive Protein, Sed rate, BUN CREA, ALP ALT AST, RH Factor, Aldolase, Chronic Hep Screen, Vit B 12, TSH w FT4 Ref, CBC, Edif, Platelet, HLA-B27, ANA Screen IFA.",

    "text": "Yesterday was supposed to be my first appointment with a rheumatologist but the person I saw was an MD of internal medicine still studying to be a rheumatologist. \n\nI was sent due to an ANA of 1:2560 and slightly elevated CRP. I have plenty of symptoms of my immune system being out of whack but so far everything else has been negative in blood work. I told her all of my symptoms and she basically said I don\u2019t have any symptoms of something AI. \n\nI asked what it means then for me to have such a high ANA (basically the top of the test range). She said I\u2019m a woman and women often have a positive ANA so that\u2019s probably why. I asked \u201cThis HIGH??\u201d And she said it\u2019s possible. \n\nI\u2019ve learned that the famous C virus of the last two years is the new anxiety and depression. If you ever mention you had it then doctors just assume that\u2019s what it is. So her answer is C-induced Fibromyalgia.  Even though that was March 2020. She said rheumatologists are not diagnosing AI for patients that have had it because their blood work is otherwise normal (I know this is BS). \n\nI showed her the rash photos I\u2019ve been having and she said it doesn\u2019t count because it doesn\u2019t spare the nasolabial folds (I disagree as does the NP who referred me, DM me if you want me to share photos). She looked at my face where it\u2019s clearly still visible and said it\u2019s probably from wearing a mask during the appointment\u2026 I asked her why am I having low grade fevers every day and she said it\u2019s common in Fibro. I told her I\u2019m on a six month round of antibiotics for recurrent infections and somehow got an ear infection on these antibiotics where I woke up with hearing loss on Father\u2019s Day and she said it\u2019s normal. \n\nShe basically told me to take 4000mg of Tylenol every day and see if it helps (RIP liver). But I want to know what\u2019s going on and treat it so I don\u2019t have to take Tylenol in the first place!! She essentially took more blood work that I\u2019ve already had and said if it\u2019s all negative it\u2019s Fibro and I can ask my psychiatrist for Gabapentin. I don\u2019t feel like I have Fibro. I have extended family that are diagnosed and I don\u2019t relate to some of the symptoms like tender points. the high ANA and rash also seem weird for Fibro but she had no answers and neither does Google. \n\nI think I need to get a second opinion but I\u2019m feeling like what\u2019s the point? It\u2019s not like any test I take can definitively say I have an AI unless it\u2019s progressed enough to show in blood work. It\u2019s not like I want one. I just want answers and Fibro doesn\u2019t feel like the right answer. I asked if it\u2019s possible to be in early stages of something AI and she said it\u2019s possible but she doesn\u2019t think I need to suppress my immune system without more severe illness because the side effects of medication are worse than the diseases themselves\u2026 huh? I asked what can I do about my diminishing quality of life and difficulty working and she basically said she can\u2019t help because nothing in my blood work tells her what\u2019s going on and my joints felt great to her. Quoting her: \u201cYour joints are so great If bring med students in here to show them what normal joints feel like.\u201d",

Make a time line of your symptoms, keep a daily journal that includes the type and location of your pain and what medication you're using to relieve it. Log things like your temperature when you have a low grade fever. I use an app called Bearable but there are lots of others out there.

    "title": "Alopecia, Stomach Problems, and Headache",
    "text": "Hey everyone. I'm hoping someone here might have some hints about what may be going on with me.\n\nAbout 4 months ago or so, I noticed that the hair on the top of my head seemed to be thinning out and I could literally pull it out in some places. I sort of just thought \"huh, well, I'm in my 30s and it runs in my family\" and just accepted that I was losing my hair. Then about 6 weeks ago I noticed a large bald patch in my beard. It seemed to happen quickly. Over the following week or two, I started developing the coin-sized bald spots in random places throughout my hair and beard that are typical of alopecia. Today, it seems to be somewhat growing back in places, but still spreading in others. I also seem to have a touch of a headache every day. Nothing seriously painful or anything, just enough that I can notice it. Sort of like the kind of headache you get if you're mildly dehydrated or spent a little too much time in the sun, kinda thing. I've also had stomach problems for the past few years, really. I don't really know exactly how to describe it. Just a general discomfort. No nausea and it seems to temporarily go away after eating. It's usually the worst when I first wake up in the morning, before I eat breakfast.\n\nWhen I last saw my doctor (a little over a month ago) she thought it was autoimmune related. I did a bunch of lab work. Tested for diabetes, testosterone, thyroid, etc. There's probably a few things I was tested for that I can't quite remember, but I think she was pretty thorough and everything came back normal. My blood pressure and heart rate is within the healthy numbers. The higher end of healthy, but still healthy. The last time I checked it, it was 119/78 and heart rate around 80. I've had kidney and liver functions tested in recent times and no issues.\n\nThe only strong clue I have is one of my cousin's has coeliac disease. When I was visiting my aunt a few days ago and she asked about my hair, she told me my cousin had it. He didn't have symptoms until his 30s and it began with stomach problems and alopecia. Alopecia associated with coeliac is very rare, but I've found a few studies about it and it's not unheard of. He did a test (blood test?) that came back positive, but no biopsy. When he went on a strict gluten-free diet he stopped having issues, his hair grew back, and he has been fine for years.\n\nThe only other autoimmune condition I researched that typically leads to headaches and, rarely, alopecia is Lupus. However, I don't have any other typical symptoms. No rash, fever, joint pain, etc.\n\nFor some family background, my father has suffered from Crohn's disease for many years. It began in his 30s. He also has rheumatoid arthritis. He receives an infusion of Humira (started with Remicade) every few weeks and this has kept both conditions under control for years. My mother has plaque psoriasis for sure, as this is visible. Outside of that, it's very difficult to get an understanding of her other health conditions, as she is also a hypochondriac. This isn't diagnosed or anything and I'm not a psychiatrist/psychologist, but it's been very clear for many years and my sister and I, along with my father, generally agree on this. For example, she will show me a lab requisition where she is being tested for a certain condition and assert that she has said condition, without there being any actual results yet. Then she won't speak about it again, and so on. For most of my life, she has pretty much always been \"sick\" without any real diagnosis or known conditions. I hate to say it, but I believe my mother uses illness for attention or other psychological reasons. That said, she claims to have Sj\u00f6gren syndrome and Vasculitis. She is also for sure a type 2 diabetic. This can be explained with the typical reasons: sedentary lifestyle, poor diet, very overweight, etc.\n\nAs for myself, the only autoimmune disease I have ever dealt with is psoriasis. Furthermore, I have a fairly rare type called guttate psoriasis, which is triggered by the immune response to strep throat. It generally begins as small, round patches a few weeks after recovering from the strep and slowly gets worse over a period of weeks, lasts for months, then slowly goes away. This first happened when I was 19, a few weeks after recovering from strep, which is typical. It was originally mistaken for an allergic reaction to the penicillin I was taking for strep. It happened again a few years later and I didn't take antibiotics, but the psoriasis happened again. This eventually lead to a diagnosis of guttate psoriasis. This has happened 4 times in my life and, normally, my skin is fine and I have no sign of psoriasis.\n\nI have gone through a very rough few years and the alopecia seemed to correspond with a rather tragic incident in my life a few months ago. I initially chalked it up to a stress response. The stomach problems I attributed to abusing alcohol heavily for about a year straight and maybe poor diet during the same time. I went through a period where I was quite depressed and drinking heavily and I thought maybe I had just done some sort of damage to stomach. But, I've been more or less sober for quite some time and there seems to be more to all of this, especially with the daily headaches starting in recent weeks. \n\nI'd love to hear some thoughts on all of this. Sorry to be long-winded. Just trying to be thorough.",

It\u2019s linked [here](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/941014)\n\nAnd I wonder.. because low vitamin D levels are at epidemic proportions worldwide.. can regular testing and proper supplementation help stave off onset in people of all ages??\n\nBy proper supplementation I mean that it\u2019s important to know that D interacts with your Calcium stores.. so it\u2019s important to take the D3+K2 form of this vitamin, so that K2 can be the Traffic Cop to direct calcium properly to teeth and bones, not let it go to heart or circulatory system, for example. D supplementation also draws on your Magnesium stores, so Mag is an important cofactor of D, Magnesium Glycinate is a good form to take. I read the best reviews of SportsResearch D3+K2 and Magnesium Glycinate 400mg from The Vitamin Shoppe, but those are just my choices.\n\nYou can test both D land Omega3 levels :) by mail :)  ( worldwide) through OmegaQuant, a lab that tests for the Olympics. Covered by insurance if ordered by your doctor, read the FAQ in main page footer. I do this at least 2x a year.\n\nTesting for ALL vitamins and minerals such as ALL of the B vitamins is important because many carry genetic anomalies making them incapable of properly metabolizing them, so special versions are necessary. Other vitamins included in excess in multivitamin preparations can actually build up slowly over time and cause health problems, another reason why testing is so important.. what you can\u2019t see can hurt you.\n\nMany aren\u2019t aware of the epidemic proportions of D deficiency worldwide. Usually worse in winter, further from the Equator, in areas where people get less sun, it can also affect people on the Equator, too. The more melanin in your skin, the less D sunlight exposure will provide. If you or someone you know has an autoimmune condition, please share this information with your blood relatives or theirs? Wouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if this could be avoided?\n\nsource\n\n[https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/941014](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/941014)\n\n&#x200B;",

    "title": "Could taking collagen supplement have led to an autoimmune condition (Meniere's disease)?",
    "text": "In September 2022, I experienced the first sign of a disease called \"Meniere's disease\". It's pretty much a condition where fluid builds up in the inner ear randomly, and causes a bunch of short-term and long-term issues to hearing and balance over time. I experience the fluid build up in episodes. The scientific term for the fluid buildup is \"**Endolymphatic hydrops**\". In between the episodes, my ears are normal, for now.\n\nIn December 2022, I started getting these episodes a lot more regularly.\n\nThe cause of the Meniere's disease is unknown. Some scientists suspect it's auto-immune, viral, allergy, or cardiovascular issue. It's a rule-out disease, meaning that if the doctor doesn't know what's causing your ear symptoms, it's classified as a Meniere's disease.\n\nOk so that's the background story. Now here's the part about collagen supplements:\n\nI have started taking a collagen supplement in powder form starting in about June 2022. I've noticed it helped with my back pain mostly. I've taken about one large scoop of it everyday, which is about 15 grams of collagen protein.\n\n**I've been tracking my diet over the last month to find out the triggers for my Meniere's episodes. And while I am still not 100% certain, I think consuming the collagen might be a potential trigger.**\n\nAnd I did some research and found these studies:\n\n1. Type 2 collagen-induced autoimmune endolymphatic hydrops in guinea pigs: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6623056/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6623056/)  \nActual article: [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1691947](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1691947)\n2. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2751214/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2751214/)\n3. [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0531513103009610](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0531513103009610)\n\nThese studies all suggest that the scientists were able to induce the symptoms of Meniere's disease (endolymphatic hydrops, hearing loss, balance issues), by either having the guinea pigs ingest or inject type 2 collagen or type 2 collagen antibodies.\n\nNow, here are my questions.\n\n1. The studies seem to be concluding that an autoimmune response against type 2 collagen in the inner ear is responsible for the endolymphatic hydrops, and therefore injecting the animals type 2 collagen triggered these symptoms in their ear. However, collagen is naturally produced by our body & also makes up the inner ear organ. So does this mean that the guinea pigs that developed the autoimmune response naturally had some low level autoimmune disorder in the first place and this was exaggerated due to the high collagen exposure? Or was feeding them high amount of collagen enough to suddenly create this autoimmune disorder out of the blue?\n2. Is it possible that my body developed an autoimmune condition to type 2 collagen in the inner ear due to the continuous ingestion of collagen supplement over the last 6 months?\n3. Reaching for straws here. Do you think it's possible that I have developed an allergic reaction to the bovine collagen only, meaning that if I stop taking it, my Meniere's disease will stop? I have found studies where patients were only allergic to bovine collagen and not human collagen. Although this was only for topical applications or some kind of implants.\n\nI am thinking this is not likely because once injected, I am sure the bovine collagen converts to human type collagen?",

    "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nThis is my first post here and I\u2019m desperate to talk to anyone who understands or has been through this. \n\nI\u2019m a 25 F and was diagnosed with moderate-severe Crohn\u2019s when I was 17. I went on Remicade and stayed on that for about 5 years, insurance made me switch to generic Inflectra for 2 years, and last year around September, it stopped working. I was hospitalized for two weeks in December, they tried to start me on Skyrizi, but I had an allergic reaction and it was considered failed. They then put me on Avsola. I developed severe rare inverse psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis while on it, and it was determined that the Avsola also failed as of the beginning of August this year. I just tried Stelara for the first time last Friday, and by Sunday was in the ER covered in hives and having a severe reaction. Now this is being considered failed too.\n\nI\u2019ve been through 5 biologics now, 4 of which have all been failed in less than a year, and I\u2019m at a point where I can\u2019t even see any other options that will work for both. My doctors think I\u2019m allergic to anything that is an IL-23 inhibitor, so that rules out a lot of the newest treatment options. They think anti TNFs just don\u2019t work for me anymore. I can\u2019t keep living like this. I\u2019ve lost so much of my life to this already, everything I\u2019ve ever loved and built for myself, and I\u2019m absolutely crumbling. I can\u2019t just be on prednisone for the rest of my life either, it wreaks havoc on my mental health and physical health in horrible other ways.\n\nHave any of you been in the same boat? Did you find something that worked for you even when it looked like nothing else was an option? Did you have to start on multiple biologics at once? I\u2019m seriously at the point where no matter how hard I try, hope isn\u2019t enough to keep my head above the water.",

I\u2019ve failed 8 biologics; this happened over the course of about 14 years, but I\u2019m only in my late 20s. I have a few pieces of advice for you to consider, the first being to get a few different opinions. If you have a good GI currently, they should encourage this and work with someone else to help you. I\u2019d specifically seek a second opinion at a tertiary care center; academics are generally better at approaching complexity. It may be different in IBD/GI, but every rheumatologist I\u2019ve seen only turns their back on TNFis as a drug class if someone fails 2-3 different drugs\u2014so like Remicade AND Humira, vs. Remicade and any of its biosimilars, like Inflectra. This is especially true if you\u2019ve developed HAMA, or human anti-mouse antibodies, that could render Remicade and co. specifically ineffective. So again, a second opinion could be useful here. I think you still have a couple drug classes you haven\u2019t tried, but I empathize with anxiety of running out of options (and how much prednisone worsens that anxiety). Because I\u2019ve been prednisone-dependent too, my doc went for something unconventional\u2014Cytoxan\u2014and while that was scary for me to accept, so far it\u2019s not making me very sick, and the hope is a sustained response from a 3-month course. Hang in there! You are not alone.",

In the last five years they've gotten a lot worse.  \n\nHypermobile people often have joint pain, but I'm having worse joint pain and inflammation particularly in wrists and hands, ankles and feet.  Plus mouth sores, groin sores, horrible fatigue, not being able to hold my head up more than a few hours.  My metabolism seems messed up and thyroid has a big cyst. I often have a temperature in the evening.  I often have night sweats. And have Raynauds which makes my feet painfully cold evrn in summer. (Got a heating pad on my feet right now.)\n\nIn last five years I've gone from having lots of sore throats to almost always having a sore throat which sets off migraines or neuralgia.  Im having Increasing trouble with swallowing and choking, and aspirating food sometimes.  I feel like I've got the flu a lot if the time.  It's honestly hard to tell if I have a virus or if I'm having a flare.  \n\nBefore, my drs thought my symptoms were all from my hypermobile disorder.  But now they are thinking it's something else.  I haven't had much testing but my sedimentation rates are above 50 mm/hr and c reactive protein also high.  Otherwise my cholesterol has gone way up when it used to be low.  Haven't had the ANA or rheumatoid factor tested in at least a few years.\n\nI had a yearly ssdi checkup a month ago, was supposed to get a rheumatology referral and it got lost it was entered wrong.  I got a message today about making this appointment and now have an appointment for Tuesday September 3.  \n\nI'm wondering if anybody can suggest how to bring stuff up to this new dr?  Should I make a list of symptoms or changes and give that to the dr?  I'm wondering if I will be diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder.  And I'm a bit scared although I'd like some treatment options.  \n\n(Also if anybody here has EDS, marfans, stickler syndrome, or similar it would be interesting to hear from you.)\n\nI really hope things can change because my life has been getting smaller.  I'm doing my counseling but now my dr and therapist say I HAVE TO get some physical diagnosis because this is not just \"being depressed\". \n\n",

    "text": "Hi everyone! I am posting on behalf oy my dad:  \n  \n**I'm a 58-year-old male (5'11, weighing 87 kg), dealing with chronic pain and inflammation for years.**\n\nI've seen rheumatologists and orthopedists who have diagnosed me with everything from ankylosing spondylitis to fibromyalgia to myofascial pain. My last MRI showed significant spinal deformation (L1-L6, S1-S2) causing nerve impingement.\n\nHere's a summary of what life is like now:\n\n* **Walking:** Reduced to less than 50 meters triggering severe inflammation, nerve impingement, and pain. Yoga is no longer an option due to extreme stiffness.\n* **Treatments Tried:** Swimming, physiotherapy, massages, and upper-body exercises have offered some relief, but nerve pain and burning sensations persist.\n* **Symptoms:** Pain, burning, numbness in legs, cervical and shoulder pain, and unusual knocking sounds in my knees and shoulders.\n* **Additional Issues:** Decreased urine flow (without prostate problems) and severe back pain after my first COVID-19 infection, which left me unable to walk for a month.\n\nA brief timeline of my condition:\n\n1. **Age 27:** Diagnosed with early arthritis; dietary changes and physiotherapy helped, but pain returned with normal eating.\n2. **Age 32:** Weight increased from 72kg to 90 kg; extreme piles treated with surgery; severe leg pain after walking long distances\n3. **Age 37:** Controlled eating habits helped regain some fitness, but numbness and pain persisted\n4. **Age 40-44:** Shifted focus to brisk walking after losing the ability to run; MRI suggested ankylosing spondylitis, but tests (HLA-B27 and CRP) were normal. Despite weak digestion, gastric issues, and elevated liver enzymes, I suspected food digestion issues triggered inflammation. Eliminating wheat, sugar, and milk showed some improvement, but certain foods still caused immediate numbness\n5. **Age 52:** Walking 500 meters triggered severe inflammation. 2 COVID-19 attack worsened symptoms. Painkillers and nerve suppressants caused side effects, so I managed without them, focusing on yoga and a light diet rich in vegetables and fruits\n\n**I\u2019m seeking advice from anyone who has faced similar challenges.** Any tips or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!",

    "text": "Hey guys, I\u2019ve reached out before but wanted to do so again to hopefully get some advice. About a month and a half ago, I started experiencing a flareup of what my dermatologist has called Leukocytoclastic Vasculitis. I have been on prednisone at varying doses since then, and have experienced flares every time I try to taper down below 30 mg. I also received some decadron shots at the hospital during my most recent flareup, which was more effective but can\u2019t be done long term. In addition to the LCV, I have joint pain. The tests that the hospital did when I was admitted came back negative for lupus and other bloodwork came back relatively normal aside from high RBC and WBC. \n\nI\u2019m asking about other options than the steroids, because they make me very sick (nausea, vomiting, super fatigued). What medication is the next step? I can\u2019t see a rheumatologist until, at the earliest, 2 weeks from now and I need some relief as my semester starts on Monday. I\u2019m a masters student seeking to finish my thesis this fall and would really like to be able to actually do so\u2026\n\nWhat sort of medications have you been prescribed for this? I know I\u2019m not 100% locked in on autoimmune as an underlying cause, but I know that this can be caused by some autoimmune disorders. I want to be able to go into the doctor\u2019s appointment prepared so I can ask directly for a specific treatment plan. Also, if you know of any bloodwork I should ask for, please let me know!",

    "text": "I will precis this by saying that I have been taking 100mg+ per day of prednisolone for months at a time for 40 years, and none of these symptoms were a problems until now.  I think this is because I used to take breaks every 10 weeks or, then start pred again.  This is no longer an option, so I need to find another way to deal with the problem.  It would help to understand what is actually causing it, but as yet I cannot work this out.  I am also taking other medications, but this occurs on prednisolone alone.  This isn't the final treatment for my illness, but it's something I need to keep taking now, so need to manage side effects not change it.  I hoped I could manage this by taking breaks in the prednisolone, and this is quite effective, but even a break for 2 days resulted in sunken patches where my body had removed fat - one in the middle of my forehead.  Medical opinion seems to be that I need not to stop. Help!\n\nDetails:\n\nCurrently, I take 75mg-100mg per day of prednisolone, and 25 mg week of methotrexate.\n\nAfter about 5 weeks on prednisolone, I start to have these crazy, progressively worse reactions to the doses, and more extreme symptoms as each dose wears off.  The longer I am on it, the more unmanageable this becomes.  I don't have a lot of other side effects that others complain about (no fluid, face swelling in general, infections etc).\n\nThe effects after the doses are really rapid like anaphylaxis and involve face and neck swelling, eye lid swelling, hands and really large amounts of swelling on the bottoms of my feet - it feels like I am standing on clouds ;)  This effect wears off after a few hours. However, I also start to have increasingly dramatic symptoms away from the doses as they wear off - these are like some of my original (myositis) symptoms but about 50% worse than they were originally.  They go away if I take another prednisolone dose.\n\nOriginally I was taking the prednisolone as two 50 mg doses (morning, lunchtime) and letting it wear off over night.  But this was resulting in so much face swelling that my eyes were completely closed over and apparently the pressure is damaging my optic nerve, so I now have the dose spread 4hrly through the day.  This is much better, but still results in the same odd symptoms when I take each dose, and as each dose wears off.\n\nThe most perplexing part is that I have myositis without inflammation, so it isn't even clear what the prednisolone is treating or why I would have so much of what looks like inflammation away from doses.\n\nAny insights from personal experience would be appreciated....",

    "text": "\nHi, I was diagnosed with SFN (small fiber neuropathy) and Sjogrens in May. I am so sick of the constant pain I am in from the neuropathy and joint stiffness, so I started seeing a pain specialist.\nThe pain specialist has recommended I get UV irrigation, they said they\u2019re practically the only clinic that does this in my area. I\u2019m so dubious about this because insurance doesn\u2019t cover it and since not a lot of clinics are doing it, it just adds to my skepticism.\n\n\nIf you don\u2019t know what this treatment is: I was told that the process consists of a machine that draws your blood out and cleans it via UV light before returning your blood back to your body. This process is done to help boost the immune system. Some of my doctors believe my neuropathy might be caused by an autoimmune disease. I mentioned this to the pain clinic, and they suggested I try this treatment to reduce my body\u2019s immune activity. However, it seems like pseudoscience to me, and I\u2019m considering not pursuing it. \n\nI\u2019m looking for feedback from anyone who has tried this treatment and whether it made a difference. The pain clinic also mentioned that my neuropathy could be long-COVID symptoms, even though I never tested positive for the virus. I want to note that I work in the medical field and was COVID-PCR tested by my work every time I had cold or flu symptoms during the pandemic, and I tested negative every time.\n\nThis place also does physical therapy and chiropractic stuff and I\u2019m considering those options.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Have you done this, and what has worked for you?\n\nThanks in advance.",

    "title": "helpless daughter seeking insight on mom\u2019s sudden health crisis",
    "text": "I\u2019m sorry for the long post. I\u2019m looking for any insight on my mom\u2019s deteriorating over the past 8 weeks. I\u2019m 24 & have become her main caregiver and advocate. It\u2019s so heartbreaking to see her like this. I\u2019ll try to keep it as short as i can & answer any additional questions in the comments.\n\nBackground: Over the last 2 months, my mom, 59, has been grappling with a severe health crisis that started with joint pain & quickly escalated to complete immobility. It all began with moderate joint pain that dramatically worsened within weeks, affecting nearly every joint except her hips. The pain was so severe that she soon required a walker & became virtually bedridden, managing to get up only to use the bathroom.\n\n1st ER Visit & Mismanagement: Our 1st ER visit resulted in a temporary pain relief with Toradol after an 8-hour wait to see and get cleared by a PA. Blood tests showed a CRP level of 104 mg/dL, indicating high inflammation. For reference, anything over 10 mg/dL is considered high. We were sent home with no effective treatment plan, no steroids to keep the worsening inflammation at bay, only advice to see a rheumatologist, but no referrals. Shockingly, we were also given a prescription for Ativan, which when we got home quickly realized was mistakenly given to my mom and was another patient\u2019s prescription for anxiety.\n\nGetting Care: Getting an appointment with a rheumatologist urgently was nearly impossible with some wait times up to 6 months. After several calls and expressing our urgency, we finally got an appointment that would be in 10 days. To try to help her get through to the appointment, my mom\u2019s PCP prescribed her 40 mg Prednisone for 7 days. She hardly responded to it, she would only have a very short relief window daily with pain always returning.\n\nRheumatologist Visits: The 1st one was discouraging; the doctor seemed dismissive before even conducting thorough exams, suggesting it was probably not rheumatological in nature and casually and apathetically mentioned the possibility of cancer or an infectious disease. He seemed to latch on immediately to the fact that the prednisone didn\u2019t work for her, & that she would\u2019ve responded if it was actually an autoimmune or rheumatological issue.\n\nWorsening: The same day of the 1st rheumatology visit, my mom began experiencing swelling in her leg (knee all the way down). Over the next two days, she was having severe bilateral edema in her legs. Another visit to the ER was prompted by unbearable pain and mobility issues. She was in significantly worse condition this time and taken in right away. Her CRP peaked at 225 mg/dL, & she had high WBC levels. Even so, effective treatment was elusive. A CT scan done in the hospital of her chest/heart and abdomen came back unremarkable. A doppler ultrasound was performed on her legs to rule out blood clots. She have some excess fluid in the legs, potentially attributed to the rupturing baker's cysts in her knees from the swelling. That was not explored any further.\n\n2nd Hospital Visit: She was admitted (outpatient status) to the hospital for further testing and observation and given pain meds/steroids through IV. The first internist she saw also tried her on antibiotics to see if  it was a viral infection. She saw an ID doctor the second day, & all of y he infectious disease blood workup was normal. On the 3rd day of admission, her new internist said that he was going to switch her status to inpatient admitted and that she would be moving upstairs to a bed once one was available, Then, 30 minutes later, she unexpectedly receives a call from the hospital social worker saying that she was all good to go and she was going to be discharged to a subacute rehab facility, was cleared for PT and that he would bring a list of SARs for her to pick from and be transported to. She was prematurely pushed into deciding between inadequate care options: going home or moving to a subacute rehab facility, neither of which was suitable given her acute condition. She opted to go home, was rushed out of the room with little assistance, and remained in severe pain.\n\nPost-Hospital: After leaving the hospital once again w/ no care plan or pain management, we called her PCP, explained the situation and  they prescribed her methylprednisolone, a 5-day medrol pack taper. This was the 1st time that she actually seemed to have noticeable relief, but, as we feared it was only temporary. By the time she had completed the taper, no improvement occurred. \n\nThe follow-up with the rheumatologist was frustratingly inadequate. Continuing to harp on her lack of response to the prednisone, even after telling him that she did in fact get relief from the medrol pack, he began rattling off other tests: a MRA, looking into cardiological issues, scans of the brain.  He also put her on a longer steroid taper (4 weeks), but it was prednisone again, at an even smaller dosage. After speaking with him on the phone the other day and telling him she wasn\u2019t having relief, he said she should go see an oncologist then.\n\nCurrent Situation: Her health has not improved; she is still bedridden, experiencing severe pain, and has lost significant muscle mass. The medical care provided has been consistently unhelpful and disorganized, with specialists providing little to no actual support or actionable advice. She\u2019s been on short-term disability now since May, but she will unfortunately be losing her job mid August, which means she will also lose her benefits. We have about 5 weeks to try and get in all these appointments and tests, but are getting nowhere. Her mental health has deteriorated and I\u2019m not sure how much longer she will be able to go on. I\u2019m desperate for any guidance that could lead to more competent care or a better understanding of what\u2019s going on. \n\nHas anyone suffered from severe unexplained joint pain and poor medical management? Could this potentially be regarded as medical negligence? What kinds of steps should we take to seek better care, especially under tight time constraints due to loss of insurance and employment?\n\n\n\n",

The rheumatologist is somewhat correct, most of us autoimmune disease patients do respond to prednisone, but lack of response doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not autoimmune either. Also, staying on prednisone long term can cause more harm than good. But, if I were you I would try to get a second rheumatologist opinion and maybe try to get into an infectious disease doctor as well.  I have psoriatic arthritis and do I have a good friend with rheumatoid arthritis and most of the time the joint pain, joint swelling issues didn\u2019t develop that quickly. It happens over time. Your mom seems to have had it happen incredibly fast, within days/weeks, which isn\u2019t typical but not totally impossible to happen with autoimmune. Hang in there. In the mean time she needs sleep rest, healthy eating, drinking water will help give some relief. People also use Epsom salt baths, heating pads, ice packs, NSAIDS and arthritis creams to help.",

These programs may be called Consumer Directed Services (CDS), Self-Directed Services, or Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) waivers.\n\nI would also look into LDN, you may need to go through agelessrx if you can't find a doctor to prescribe it. Functional medicine providers would be your best bet, or a Physical Medicine/Pain Doctor (they are the ones that do injections and similar things). \n\nI hate to say this, but even with proper treatment, she may not be able to improve enough to work or live independently. You may want to start thinking about downsizing and simplifying your lives as much as possible. \n\nPlease take care of yourself too. If you have any questions don't hesitate.",

    "text": "I was diagnosed with ITP around 7 months ago, after my platelet count dropped in the 20s and 30s. My hematologist tested me against a ton of other potential causes, including lupus, but thinks ITP is the cause, related to stress. \n\nI think a month and a half of steroid treatment, which boosted my platelets, but since March, they\u2019ve been coming down, most recently back in 30s. We\u2019re considering different options but steroids seem to be the only one available. The question I have is - how do you guys deal with the extreme fatigue? I find myself unable to get out of bed, exhausted at all times, needing naps during the day, some that go hours. I feel like I\u2019m unable to make myself do anything these days, which is so frustrating. ",

    "text": "cross posting for reach and to get a varying amount of perspectives** \n\nhi there, i have hEDS, POTS, and suspected MCAS (proper care for these is hard to come by in Ontario though, I feel super failed by the system and have very few answers and access to very few diagnostics and treatments). I also have a number of other comorbidities like PCOS, GERD, possible CCI,  iron deficient anemia, etc. i also have really widespread petachie all over my body if that\u2019s at all helpful. \n\nFor a couple years now (ever since my EDS, POTS started to seriously progress) I have been dealing with these full body neuropathy-like symptoms. For the last year and especially the last few months - it has become so unbearable I have almost no quality of life. \n\nIt is worth noting that right before these symptoms started, I had about 4 episodes of this weird full body burning. and I mean my entire body. It almost always happened at night / when trying to fall asleep. My POTS was also getting worse at this time and I was having a lot of heart racing and was felt like adrenaline dumps at night. when it happened, It was like this instant wave of a heat feeling over my body, like an immediate full body severe sunburn. I would jump up right away and be like \u201choly shit\u201d and the first time even jumped in a cold shower it was so hot and painful. There was no redness, rashes, or anything visible on my body. I kind of assumed it was some werid allergic reaction? I didn\u2019t even know I had EDS at the time so i truly had no idea and my doctor at the time was not a good person or doctor and i got no answers at all. the episodes eventually stopped but my full body neuropathy slowly started afterwards and has progressed over time. \n\nmore on the neuropathy and how it presents now:\n\n- it comes and goes but lately has been much more constant \n- it is like a prickling/stinging. like getting stung by bees all over my body. but not my entire body at once, if that makes sense? sometimes there is this underlying buzzing/stinging but on top of that i can feel each individual sting very clearly. it really hurts, honestly. and sometimes i\u2019ll end up feeling really really itchy as well. \n- it is literally not localized anywhere (and this has really boggled neurologists i\u2019ve seen, as they say it\u2019s not presenting as typical neuropathy). i\u2019ll get it in all my limbs, chest, back, stomach, face, mouth, scalp, fingers and toes, sometimes i even feel it in my throat and eyes. \n- i don\u2019t rly have any other typical neuropathy symptoms. no numbness, loss of sensation, burning, or electric shocks. sometimes i get a bug crawling feeling on my arms and legs where i have hair. usually if i\u2019m wearing loose clothing. this has made neurologists in the past confused and one even said they didn\u2019t think EMG would be useful for me because \u201che didn\u2019t even know where he would do it\u201d. although i\u2019m not sure how accurate that was and am seeing a new neurologist soon. \n- it seems to be worse at certain times of my cycle maybe? it is also worse when my POTS is worse (although i don\u2019t know which is triggering what). it\u2019s worse when i get hot. it tends to be worse at night and usually goes hand in hand which what feels like adrenaline dumps. sometimes, when my POTS is flaring i get this feeling of adrenaline running through my body and what i call \u2018heart drops\u2019 where it\u2019s like that dropping feeling of doom in your chest when your afraid or panicking - but i\u2019m not anxious? it just happens. this is worse when my pain is worse. \n- also, it tends to be worse when i eat things i know trigger me but not always (like dairy, hugh sugar, i haven\u2019t figured out my other food triggers yet). a lot of the time when it happens i get more flushing, sometimes hives, sneezing, acid reflux, IBS symptoms, skin writing, itchiness, etc. which sometimes makes me think it\u2019s MCAS related? i also know that hyperPOTS and MCAS can go hand in hand.\n\nsome other things to note: \n\n- my b12 levels are normal. i\u2019m anemic and slightly low in vitamin d and have been supplementing but it hasn\u2019t eased my symptoms. i\u2019m not diabetic. MS has been ruled out with an MRI. my CRP has been consistently raised for a few years and my doctor pretty much says \u201cidk\u201d about that one. I had a normal ANA a few years ago but haven\u2019t had any other autimmmune markers checked since. I had a tryptase of 6.3 ug/L but was taking antihistamines at the time. \n- i take claritin twice a day, quercetin 500mg twice a day, pepcid once daily. i take a PPI for GERD (pls don\u2019t tell me to go off it, it\u2019s very much not an option for me sadly). i\u2019m on LDN (just started tho). i drink nettle tea. salt pills and electrolytes for POTS. the MCAS symptoms i was having a few years ago we\u2019re definitely alleviated by the claritin, pepcid, quercetin. like i had sooo much less flushing and hives and air hunger and throat itching and other symptoms. but the neuropathy / stinging just kept getting worse slowly then all at once. and now the mcas symptoms are coming back, especially itching and skin writing and flushing. \n\ni\u2019m sorry this is so long, maybe i\u2019ll post a shorter, condensed version later. i\u2019m new to reddit so i\u2019m sorry if anything in this post isn\u2019t okay!! i\u2019m not looking for medical advice or diagnosis. mostly just like, if anyone has similar experiences? or words of support. or if anyone has any ideas that could push me in the right direction. even looking in the neuropathy sub i\u2019m not seeing a lot of people who have this experience - so i thought making my own post would be a good idea. i promise i\u2019m going to doctors and am not relying on reddit for this - but also doctors are really failing me. i\u2019m even thinking of trying to take out a line of credit to get care in the states. doctors are so behind on research here in ontario and there are so few options (like there is literally 1 MCAS doctor). literally anything, anyone has to add or offer would be so meaningful. thank you.",

    "title": "My Experience with Gillian Barre Syndrome",
    "text": "&#x200B;\n\n**June 3rd 2023 scariest day of my life-**\n\nIt all started about two weeks prior to this date. I started experiencing tingling in my finger tips that then spread into my toes. It was a subtle tingle that would come and go throughout the day. I thought maybe I had pinched a nerve, was possibly diabetic or anemic, or was just something that might go away on its own. I then went to California with my best friend for Memorial Day weekend and it was then that the tingling in my hands and feet got worse and more severe. I noticed while taking a shower that the tingling seemed to be a more intense feeling and felt like everything was getting tight. I then was walking around California in my sneakers and noticed that I could not feel my right big toe. It was completely numb and felt as if it was detached with a rubber band around it. I then went that entire weekend dealing with the tingling, tightness and my big toe being numb. I flew back to my parents house that Monday, Memorial Day since I was going to be traveling from their house back to Spokane where I live. I got to my parents home and noticed that my tongue, mouth and upper back felt completely numb. I instantly got worried, scared and upset. My mom suggested we go to the emergency room at this point since things just seemed to be getting worse and spreading around.\n\n**May 29th 2023** \\- Memorial Day we went into the ER and waited to be seen, they took my blood and did a cat scan of my head. I have had headaches my entire life but I had been having a constant headache over the last couple weeks, so they did a scan. The results of my blood and scan came back and the doctor came to us and said \u201ceverything looks normal but based off of your tingling symptoms it could most likely be MS. So they will need to do a MRI at another time. Does that make you feel worse or better?\u201d I instantly started crying and my stress and worries sky rocketed. It was the worst thing someone could have said to me during that scary time and I will never forget that doctors face kneeling down by me saying that. My mom and I left the ER and went home. I was devastated, scared and terrified. I just kept thinking I am healthy, young and active, how could this be happening?! The next day my friend and I needed to drive back to Yakima where she was living so that I could get my car and drive back to Spokane. I was nervous to leave my parents but I knew we would only be 5 hours apart and I needed to get back to work, just hoping this would all go away.\n\n**May 30th 2023** \\- My friend and I are on our way driving back to Yakima (3 hour drive) and I notice that my vision is going blurry. I still couldn\u2019t feel my big toe, tingling in my hands, feet and back and now my vision?!?! I was getting more stressed and worried by the second. My friend then drove me to the nearest ER because after looking up the possibilities online and the worsening of my symptoms, it seemed like the only option. We then get to the Ellensberg ER where they check me in, take blood samples and give me an IV with fluids. This time they checked all my vitamin levels to see if I was possibly anemic which could explain the tingling I was experiencing. I prayed and prayed that it would come back with low vitamin levels and that was all it would be. However, it did not. The doctor said all my levels looked great and that he wasn\u2019t sure what was going on and suggested I get an MRI scheduled. I was again devastated and so upset. The next day I decided I could brave the drive and drive the 3 more hours to my home in Spokane. During that drive my right eye was getting very dry and the tingling was worsening. But I finally made it home. I told my friends and boyfriend that I lived with all about what happened while I was gone and that I wasn\u2019t even sure how I drove home. By that night my face stared to feel numb and started to droop. I couldn\u2019t smile normal anymore and the left side of my face was dropping. I thought I had developed Bell\u2019s palsy over the course of the day. By the end of the night it had just gotten worse and worse. My friend who is a nurse got home from her shift and said that we needed to go back to the ER immediately. She was worried that it could be a stroke.\n\n**May 31st 2023** \\- They then rushed me to the ER in Spokane and the second the security saw me she called CODE STROKE over the intercom. Within 30 seconds I was rushed back, had an IV in my arm and was surrounded my about 15 nurses and doctors. They all were doing different things, asking me stroke questions such as the the weather, the date and having me identify things in photos. They determined I was not having a stroke and that I needed to get an MRI. I then waited while they took my blood, did a EKG and sent me off to my 45 minute brain MRI. A couple hours later the doctor came in with the results of my blood, EKG and MRI. He said that my blood results and heart looked normal and that he did not believe I had Bell\u2019s palsy but rather it was related to stress. However, my MRI did show a couple spots of white matter. He stated that it showed a few spots that could indicate an autoimmune disease or could be from my history of headaches since they were very small spots. He said that your mind is very strong and that it was important I stay positive and to follow up with my primary care doctor to see a neurologist. I again was at a loss for words and completely devastated and terrified. The next day I went to my primary care doctor appointment that I had scheduled awhile back. I told her everything that had happened and she referred me out to a neurologist. My parents drove over from Vancouver Washington to Spokane to be with me because I called them feeling helpless with this news of the unknown and my worsening symptoms. My parents got to my house and by the end of the night I started to become wobbly and was loosing my balance. The next day was Friday June 2nd and My hands, feet, back, face, mouth were tingling and numb feeling and then my balance progressively got worse over the course of the day. My legs began to cramp in my calves and felt as if they were becoming weaker and weaker as the day went on. The neurologist clinic called and said they had No appointments until august! It seemed as though everything was getting worse hour by hour and I didn\u2019t think I could wait 3 months to be seen. By the end of the night I had called the doctor that I babysit for and she advised that I go back to ER and demand a complete work up and a spinal tap.\n\n**June 3rd 2023** \\- My parents, boyfriend and I got up at 7 in the morning and made our way back to the ER in Spokane. I could barley walk as my legs had become so weak that I could barley lift them up. Thankfully the ER wasn\u2019t too busy yet and they got me back pretty quickly. I once again for the 4th time being at the ER this week told them all my symptoms and they took another blood sample. At this point I could barley walk, my face was paralyzed and I had zero energy. We requested they do a spinal tap since the doctor I babysat for suggested it. After waiting awhile the doctor came in and said that he didn\u2019t believe it was MS based on his experience diagnosing it and that he didn\u2019t want to do a spinal tap because of the risks that come with doing those. He said it could be something called GBS-Gillian Barre syndrome but that we just won\u2019t know until it gets worse. My mom told the doctor that she didn\u2019t mean to be rude but that the next time we come in it will probably be by ambulance and she is getting worse by the minute, we cannot wait until august to see a neurologist. He looked her in the eye and said okay I will get the neurologist to come see you today. I was so thankful for my mom advocating for me and getting someone to do something for me! Dr. Costa the neurologist came into the room an hour or so later. She was intense but nice and down to business. She had me show her my facial movements, stand up to do walking tests and within 5 minutes of being in the room said she was 99 percent sure it was Gillian barre syndrome and that I was going to need to be admitted into the hospital as this sickness can move quickly. She ordered almost every blood test you could think of (the nurse taking my blood samples said she had never seen so many requested), a spinal tap and another MRI of my brain, neck and spine. I was so scared but also had a feeling of happiness that someone was finally believing me and going to help me. The doctor then came in and performed the spinal tap on me, which is where they use a long needle to extract spinal fluid. They test the spinal fluid for many things but they were mostly looking for my protein level, a high protein level is very common for GBS. They also use it to look for any other autoimmune diseases like MS or other infections. After finding me a room on the 8th floor in the hospital they rolled me up to it. I got to my room and then they gave me some medication for my 2 hour MRI. The next day all my MRI results and spinal tap results had come back. I had a protein level of 287 in my spinal fluid and a regular protein level is around 45. My MRI also lit up all over. All of my nerve roots in my spine lit up and my cranial nerves lit up in my brain mri. Both of these findings confirmed that it in fact was Gillian Barre Syndrome. However typically when the cranial nerve is involved it is a variant of GBS called Miller Fischer. So they believed I had the Miller Fischer version of Gillian Barre. The next 8 days in the hospital were very long, tiring and scary. Although, it felt good to finally know what was going on and having a diagnosis, the unknown was still terrifying. My parents, boyfriend, brother and friends all came to see me and be there for me which helped me mentally a lot to know I had them there for me. Over the course of the next week I got five rounds of plasma exchange. I got a port inserted into my neck that would be where they would take my blood inside and out of my body to clean it, to clear out the harmful antibodies that were causing all of this. After receiving the first three rounds of the plasma exchange I began to feel a little better, I could eat a little more than just soft food and my face was beginning to move and not be as frozen. After laying in the hospital bed and only getting up to go to the bathroom, I could barely walk without assistance. I had to be hanging onto something or someone because I was so weak. The Physical therapist came and began working with me. It was the craziest feeling and experience to barely being able to walk. For the next few days the physical therapist had me using a walker to go on walks around the floor I was on. I remember just crying because I couldn\u2019t believe that I was using a walker and could barley walk but I knew the only way I was going to gain strength back in my legs and walk again was to keep practicing, so I kept going. After a few days I could tell it was getting a little easier, however I still couldn\u2019t feel the bottoms of my feet, so it felt as if I was walking on marshmallows. Finally, I got rid of the walker and for the last two days of my stay I was able to wear a belt around me and walk with someone just holding onto my belt.\n\n**June 10th** \\- I received my last round of plasma exchange and was able to go home! The doctors said that the plasma exchange would still be working in my body even after I left the hospital but that it was critical I rest and not over do it because over doing it would put my body 10 steps back. Over the course of the next 2.5 weeks after being released I just still didn\u2019t feel I was getting better but rather getting worse. I continually started feeling weaker and weaker again but then I would have a couple hours where I felt okay. I just wanted to trust that it was part of the healing process. The doctors told me that the healing process kind of goes up and down for a little while so I just kept thinking okay I am just healing. Until then my mouth went numb and my face started to not move again. I couldn\u2019t smile again. I was so frustrated, sad, mad, confused and I didn\u2019t know what was happening. Everyone around me was trying to stay positive and tell me it was just healing. But I knew, I had a gut instinct that told me it just wasn\u2019t, something wasn\u2019t right. Finally after almost 3 weeks I went back to the ER because now I could barely lift my legs to walk up the stairs again and my swallowing felt like a challenge.\n\n**July 1st** \\- Another trip to the ER. My boyfriend took me and After waiting in the waiting room for almost 5 hours I was seen and was told they needed to do another spinal tap to test my protein levels in my spinal fluid. The number had went down to 205 but still very high. So they admitted we again and sent me back to floor 8 to begin the other treatment which was called IVIG. They began this immediately, it is given through the IV and basically is injecting healthy donor antibodies to bind with my bodies bad antibodies. I felt defeated, stressed and ultimately terrified again. I just couldn\u2019t understand why it all came back and I was back in the hospital. The doctors weren\u2019t sure if it was a recurrent case of GBS or if it just hadn\u2019t reached its peak yet from the first time. Over the course of the next six days I received IVIG treatment and again started to feel a little better each day. My boyfriend stayed the entire time with me, not leaving my side once.\n\n**July 6th** \\- I got released from the hospital!! I was so excited to get out of there. The doctors said that it was so important to take it easy and just increase my activity level little by little. This was the peak of summer and it made me so sad because I could barely be outside for very long. The heat of summer made my body feel more tingly and it was really uncomfortable so I spent most of the summer inside. I just kept praying each and every day that I would get just a little better each day. I then went to the doctor and got an EMG test done on my nerves which is another way they diagnose Gillian barre syndrome. This was like the ultimate way to ensure it was in fact Gillian Barre. They hooked me up to a bunch of wires and sent electrical pulses through my nerves to where they could measure how fast the signal was moving. The signals were very very slow which is exactly what Gillian Barre is. I felt relieved to know that everything that was pointing to this diagnosis had been solidified. I also found out that I did not have the miller Fischer variant, I just had Gullian Barre with cranial nerve involvement. However, once I hit the 2.5- 3 week mark I was getting paranoid. I was scared of it coming back since that\u2019s when it came back last time. Thankfully it didn\u2019t, I just kept getting better little by little. My energy levels felt like they were getting better and my walking was better. Different parts of my body didn\u2019t feel numb anymore and just tingly. My face, hands, knees and feet still felt tingly and the bottoms of my feet still felt like marshmallows. However, I could feel that it was a different feeling of tingling, it almost felt more like a ticklish feeling as if cob webs were on my skin. It felt like I could wipe off the tingles in a way.\n\nOver the course of the next month this feeling went away and it was just a slight tingling and I realized I could feel the bottoms of my feet again!!! It happened so slowly over the course of two months that when I finally realized I could completely feel the bottom of my feet I was so relieved. I had been doing PT workouts at home and doing movements in the pool to gain mobility for the past two months that finally I started going to the gym again month three of being out of the hospital. My best friend was very motivating towards me and helped me slowly get back into doing workouts at the gym. Then one day during September my best friend started running. I decided that one day I was going to go on a run with her. I felt like I could feel my feet now, I had been going to the gym and I could definitely run at least for a little while. I ran a mile!!! It was the best feeling to be able to run again! When literally 8 weeks before that I could barely walk down the block without feeling tired.\n\n**November 7th** \\- it is now November 7th and has been about 4 months since I was released from the hospital in July. I still have tingles in my hands and feet and sometimes the tip of my nose but it is way less intense. It is very subtle tingles. My hands feel like they are vibrating in the cold and a tad more tingly still when I get warm, but overall I know it is getting better still each and every day. Nerves take a LONG time to heal and the tingling can last months to years. I can walk perfectly normal again and do all the things I used to do so I will take these tingly feelings happily! My family and friends were there for me each step of the way. I love them with all my heart and could never express how truly grateful I am for each and every one of them. It is so important to have people there for you, supporting you through something so insane and sudden like this, something that completely flips your world upside down in the matter of just a few weeks. Although, I am so incredibly grateful that it was nothing more severe. I am so thankful to be here and to be able to get better as the days go on!\n\nIf you've made it this far, thank you for reading!",

    "text": "Hi, I\u2019m 22(F), living in a country where people don\u2019t understand how autoimmune disease works. I have had asthma since I was born. However, after 5/6 years of proper treatment, it got under control when I was 12. This year, in July, I started getting bumps all over my legs. They weren\u2019t going at any cost. As Ive had allergies throughout my life, I thought having antihistamine would work. I was always on some sort of antihistamines from time to time. After like 20 days or so, realising those antihistamines aren\u2019t working, I went to a dermatologist. I was told to take 2 antihistamines and I will be fine. With time, the doctors realised that this could be a bit more serious as my legs were turning purple in places, they decided to go for punch biopsy and hence I got diagnosed with Urticarial Vasculitis. \n\nIt\u2019s been two months I am extremely sick and tired. I get asthma attacks every other day even though I\u2019m on multiple medication for my asthma. I can barely sleep. My body feels so drained out. I had to drop a semester at my uni. Even if I go out for a day, my body literally breaks down the moment I step outside of my house. My back hurts really bad. I can\u2019t taste food like before (everything tastes bland). I don\u2019t feel like talking to anyone. Everyone in my family keeps saying \u201cYour symptoms are going away, you are getting back to normal\u201d I wish I was. Life isn\u2019t the same anymore. My BP is constantly at 130/100. I\u2019ve tachycardia as well. My eyesight got a bit blurry as well. I just don\u2019t know how to deal with this anymore. I am tired of running to multiple doctors, getting my blood report done every other week for some new problems.  \nHow do I deal with this? ",

I am not trying to scare you but regular eye visits are so important. This sounds like you might need to revisit your medication and you are having side effects, esp regarding back pain and tachycardia. If your underlying health isn\u2019t addressed your other conditions will be worse, and you should maybe ask for an immune-suppressant if antihistamines are your dominant treatment. I would ask if you can get a full blood panel as well if you aren\u2019t already. \n\nI had a vasculitis reaction to a sulfa med, it worsened my asthma, and I cut my antihistamines after learning I had high risk glaucoma and started having more intense migraines (I have other medication to treat my autoimmune issues). I had tachycardia after I had an interaction between my NSAID and spironalactone. I don\u2019t feel as good but I\u2019m working on a new treatment.

    "text": "*Editing and reposting as my previous post got flagged.*\n\nHi all. Been living for several years as seronegative RA after all the basic rheumatology tests and x-rays found nothing of note - for example, my bloodwork won't turn up any inflammation, my pain is mostly in my fingers but x-rays are fine, but 2 diff rhuems agreed with diagnosis based on symptoms and family history. Treating it generally well with methotrexate; about a year ago, gabapentin was added re lower back pain (nothing seen on xrays/MRI) as possible fibro (but I've never felt like what I hear fibro patients describe!)\n\nStarting with a new rheum as my old one left and WOW she is thorough. Ordered 8 vials of labwork including some I've NEVER had done before (labcorp tech was shocked at them all haha). They ARE showing some \"abnormals\" which honestly is sort of validating because living with pain and constantly testing normal can mess with your head.\n\nI see the rheum for follow-up in 2 weeks; she reviewed these enough to say no need to come in sooner, but we haven't spoken about specifics yet. I am a THOROUGH person and wanna understand it all! Several of these are tests I\u2019ve never had done before so I don\u2019t have a comparison to previous for me either.\n\n**What questions should I be taking in with me? If you have any resources on understanding these particular tests so I can do some homework, I welcome that too!**\n\nMy list of Qs for the doctor so far is:\n\n* Can you help me understand what the abnormal findings on lupus antigcoagulants and creatine kinase means?\n* This is the 4^(th) time my A/G ratio has come back slightly elevated \u2013 can you help me understand why/how that happens? If it\u2019s not a concern, when WOULD it be a concern?\n* Is there anything in these test results that would make you reconsider my diagnosis or my current treatment?\n* Are any of these things we will need to check on again?\n*  ..anything else?\n\n\u00a0\n\nMore details on results below:\n\nI returned a speckled pattern ANA at 1:80 - this is the first time I've actually gotten a positive ANA! So like I said, sort of validating. I understand 1:80 is considered weak - one of my doctors once said \"I suspect you DO have something inflammatory and we are just catching it early before the tests do\" and this, in my mind, is in line with that. But normal for all of the specific antibodies they test for (RF, Sjogren\u2019s, etc.)\n\nFirst time I've had lupus anticoagulants tested. Flags for high dPT, thrombin time, and PTT-LA (along with a note from the lab I find very confusing! I know NOTHING about the intrinsic and extrinsic pathway factors! Does anyone have a good plain resource I can read up?)\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7evn0bo2udsd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=63070b416ba75cef07c0c7a24de2e87faa209d20\n\n\u00a0\n\nSlightly elevated A/G ratio (but, this is the 4th in a row of slightly high, so it IS on my list to ask her about), and high creatine kinase - not dangerously high, but noted. But, all the CK subtypes are normal so I don't really understand this one? Is it typical to see CK high but nothing noted in the subtypes?\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yzqmx4a3udsd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=226c230a37c01c25b0830a341a1f3f2cc3d15e4b\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\nEverything else generally normal (except for a high-ish glucose bc I have a bad habit of taking myself out for a treat BEFORE labwork to make it more tolerable haha)\n\nAppreciate any notes I can take in with me!!\n\n\u00a0",

    "text": "Hi guys, it\u2019s been a while since I last posted here. I was diagnosed with urticarial vasculitis via a biopsy in June, and my old rheumatologist started me on hydroxychloroquine 200mg twice a day for three months. Well, three months have passed, and I never noticed any improvement in my symptoms. \n\nI didn\u2019t go back to my old rheumatologist; instead, I changed to one I found online that had more experience with vasculitis since it\u2019s a rare disease. I met with her a week and a half ago and told her I felt hydroxychloroquine didn\u2019t do anything for me. After talking for a bit to get some backstory, she excused herself for a few minutes to look up on the computer if there was any new information or treatments for UV. I took it as a good sign that she was willing to do that, and she came back and told me there was nothing new, but that hydroxychloroquine doesn\u2019t really treat UV. She told me she\u2019s seen a handful of patients with UV, which was reassuring, and started me on colchicine 0.6mg.\n\nSo I\u2019ve been on colchicine for a week and a half now, and I still have yet to notice anything. Does anyone know how long it typically takes for colchicine to work? Our next meeting isn\u2019t until December, so it\u2019s another three months of monitoring and hoping it works. Hopefully it does because if not, she said she would have to switch me to Dapsone, which has some concerning side effects :/",

    "title": "Sneddon Syndrome? And How to Get a Rheumatologist to Take Me Seriously",
    "text": "Hi all,\n\nJust recently joined this board in hopes that I might get some good advice and potentially more info about what happens when your initial ANA Cascade comes back with nothing.\n\nI am female, 34 years old, living in NYC. Before this, I had had a history of hypothyroidism, papillary thyroid carcinoma with a thyroidectomy for the removal of the cancer, depression and anxiety, and had been born with a significant cleft lip and palate with complication in surgery requiring treatment even still at my age.\n\nFor the past two years I\u2019ve had a significant decline in my health, with random symptoms that have been worsening and increasing in number. Included in these issues were gradually worsening peripheral neuropathy in my left side of my body, with weakness in my arms, wrist, and hand, and in my foot/leg and issues with cognitive function, from memory, concentration, and organization (which led to a sudden \u201clate\u201d adult diagnosis of ADHD).\n\nStarting in November of 2023, I started to experience severe memory and cognitive function \u201cattacks\u201d - periods of time when it seemed like all memory and reasoning would fail. They were accompanied by headaches and dizziness, sometimes losing control on my left side, and sometimes slightly blurred vision. They freaked me out, but no one seemed concerned.\n\nI lost 40 pounds suddenly over the next four months with no lifestyle changes. I was sweating profusely at night, every night, getting low grade fevers often, and fatigue so bad I was warned at work.\n\nIn March of 2024, (after several visits to different primary care doctors, all of whom brushed me off and said I was fine after I kept testing normally against all suspicions of untested diabetes) I finally found a doctor who took my pleas seriously and was concerned with the abnormal indicators on my CBC and other bloodwork that all other docs brushed off - my platelets were quite elevated on every CBC for the past two years, my IgE indicated consistent inflammation, and my symptoms were concerning to him. He tested me for autoimmune issues and I tested low-level high abnormal (over 1:80) on an ANA Titer and got back two separate abnormal patterns on my ANA patterns.\n\nThen in early May of this year, I suffered at mini-stroke at work. I was rushed to the ER when the EMTs took one look at me, asked me to raise my left arm (I couldn\u2019t) while I tried vainly to speak to them in garbled and confused slurring, and then shouted, \u201cshe\u2019s stroking.\u201d At the hospital they pumped me with a clot buster, and kept me for four days with the diagnosis of a transient ischemic attack. By then, I\u2019d had two MRIs that indicated a questionable spot in the same place both times that could have been a lesion, or simply a migraine in the moment.\n\nIn June I finally was seen by a rheumatologist, due to all rheumatologists being so booked up in NYC and his office being the first to take me. He brushed me off at my first visit, said I was wasting his time because I had a low abnormal result, had no conclusive positives on my ANA Cascade, and my symptoms sounded made up. At that appointment however he figured out I had De Quervain\u2019s Tenosynovitis (after I repeatedly begged him to check my wrists and my joints) and said, due to that, he\u2019d check me for RA and redo the initial ANA Titer and Patterns to check for a false positive, which he suspected. He also told me he seriously doubted that I\u2019d actually had a TIA because they were technically unprovable due to the clot moving on its own.\n\nAt my second appointment, he admitted I had tested abnormal with the same Titer and Patterns as the first test, but he still thought I didn\u2019t have a rheumatological issue. He referred me to an ENT and a neurologist for the  questionable white spots on my frontal lobes for March and May\u2019s MRIs, and basically washed his hands of me.\n\nI\u2019m the last few months, I have realized that my legs have been displaying worsening livedo racemosa - initially I had though it was livedo reticularis, but not quite as organized of a pattern which made me question whether it was actually livedo reticularis or in my head - and then two nights ago after a particular dark pattern showing up on my legs (the kitchen window was open and the day was particular chilly at night) so after taking some photos and reverse image searching them, I came upon a site describing livedo racemosa, which looked exactly like my chaotic patterned legs. I looked into it and was led to Sneddon Syndrome, which fit my symptoms exactly, from the required diagnostic triad to lesser known symptoms.\n\nHere\u2019s my issue - given how rare it is, and how poorly I\u2019ve been treated by so any docs at thus point, including the rheumatologist, how can I advocate for myself strongly enough that I get a rheumatologist to take me seriously? My ANA Titer has indicated abnormal results both times, in March and June, but the levels are pretty low and my Cascade came back with nothing. I have started a photo album of my skin indicators, included clear cases of livedo racemosa on my legs, acrocyanosis of my feet/toes, and my hands/fingertips, as well as small, non-healing dark scabs on my lower legs and ankles from what I think ulceration. I have compiled a list of every symptom I have had in the past few years.\n\nI magically got a last minute appointment with a new rheumatologist for this upcoming Monday, and I want him to take me seriously, whether it is possibly Sneddon Syndrome, or something else. But I cannot continue to live like this. I need someone to take me seriously. Or tell me why I\u2019m so sick all the time.\n\nThank you for any advice and any thoughts.",

    "text": "Please let me know if this is the incorrect sub to post in as I will delete and look elsewhere. \n\nI am a 21 yr old woman. \n\nI believe this all started June 2021. I took a baby head to the face and my nose bled for twenty minutes. After that I had no symptoms. I believe it was October of the same year where symptoms started occurring and I began seeing a doctor and was recommended for surgery to correct my nose. I was finally able to see an ENT April 2022. I was diagnosed with acute recurrent sinusitis and allergic rhinitis. ENT wanted to start different treatments to alleviate symptoms: sinus rinses and using my inhaler (I have had asthma since I was 5). At this time I also had one swollen lymph node on my right side of my face right next to my earlobe. ENT said he had a lymph node for over a year and it was normal and might go away and might not. Ok, whatever. \n\nIt is now 2024, I have a new ENT and after many doctor visits, I have finally became comfortable with doing sinus rinses as of June 2024. (I felt like I was drowning myself before but now I am a champ!) A few months go I was prescribed a one week steroid and it seemed to help but I really do not want to continue medication for this and expressed that to my doctor. On my last visit, I was diagnosed with:\n\nAcute recurrent sinusitis\nAllergic conjunctivitis of both eyes\nAllergic rhinitis caused by mold\nAllergic rhinitis due to dust mite\nGastroesophageal reflux disease\nLymphadenopathy\nMild persistent asthma without complication\nVasomotor rhinitis\n\nAnd subsequently I was told to continue my sinus rinses 2x daily with added budesonide (.5mg) and also Famotodine 40mg 1x daily. I was also told I would get a follow up with my previous ENT as he had moved to a further location and I wanted to stay at the one closer to home. During that follow up I told my ENT this:\n\nI have swelling from right below my temples all the way down to my jaw on both sides of my face. I have experienced nausea and wondered if my issues are causing it. She said yes. \n\nMy question is, am I ok? Is this normal? Any advice? Health anxiety is a real b. I don\u2019t want cancer. I\u2019m scared and tired of feeling like this. \n\nLast year at this same time I was experiencing daily nausea for two weeks. I could not keep food down. I went to urgent care and everything was normal. Blood, urine, etc. I am now experiencing nausea again and pain in my lymph nodes. Another question: are there any holistic methods that are recommended to help combat lymph node swelling? \n\nI should note that I was prescribed Zofran by my psychiatrist late last year as I was experimenting with different antidepressants that were causing nausea and have had persistent nausea since then. \n\nI don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m dying but my anxiety is telling me I am. Thanks for reading and for your help. Please let me know if there is information that should be added to this post for clarity. ",

Swollen lymph nodes are indicative of your immune system functioning\n\nWhen you want to be concerned regarding lymphomas and other blood cancers is when they don't have pain, as well as additional symptoms such as sweating, itching, hardness, etc. Lymphomas and blood cancers also usually have some indicators on blood work (whether it be blood cell values or other markers) so in combination with your diagnoses, the fact that they hurt, and normal bloodwork, you shouldn't be too concerned \n\nIf it persists and your health anxiety won't quiet down, try asking your Dr for a chest / neck CT to rule out any serious abnormalities. (If you think they'll say no, try asking for a chest / neck ct to see if there's a structural basis for your ENT problems ) \n\nAnyway Goodluck, I know lymph node stuff sucks",

I told him I get head aches every day for hours with bad pressure behind my eyes and I get sick all the time, I also almost fainted at work and get very dizzy to where if I don\u2019t sit down all fall and would say it\u2019s cuz I\u2019m over weight and need to work out when I\u2019m 5\u20193 and 160. \n\nNow I have a new doctor an were in the process of getting an mri and he\u2019s checking me for a lot of different things in my blood and test but one of them is 500$, he also asked what kind of lupus I had, I just looked at him weird and said my other doctor just told me I had lupus i never knew there was different kinds, I just hope this all gets figured out cuz I can\u2019t keep getting sick and feeling soar like this I\u2019m in so much pain all the time\n",

    "text": "Hi all,\n\nI've been querying possible autoimmune, primarily lupus, with my doctor since the start of this year. Just for some background: positive ANA and extremely high CRP in January 2023, and again in January 2024, during symptomatic flares which both had me hospitalised, but came back down without any treatment (no infection, nothing viral, just an incredibly bad pain flare in my joints, skin and nerves, liver pinged on ddimer as inflamed, and enlarged spleen without any cause). Had some bloods done a month ago, all clear again, which has my doctor incredibly frustrated.\n\nRecently, I was diagnosed with trigeminal neuralgia, bilateral but with a preference for the left side of my face, came out of nowhere in May and hasn't let up entirely yet, but worsens into bad flares every so often. No medications for this aside from tramadol, carbamazepine was intolerable due to side effects making my joint pain worse. Also on eterocoxib 60mg for stiffness in joints and pain and inflammation in my knees and shoulderblades.\n\nNew symptom: armpit pain?? It feels like someone is stabbing a needle into my right armpit, if that makes sense? I don't THINK my lymph nodes are swollen, although the stinging pain is right on my right lymph node in my armpit - the pain is sharp, enough to make me stop what I'm doing, and lasts just a second, but might sting the same way a few seconds later, coming and going as little as a few times an hour to, at its peak, over 10 times a minute. No rash, no redness, nothing, just...this weird pain.\n\nAnyone experienced a weird symptom like this, just to reassure me I'm not going insane walking around complaining about my armpits? \ud83d\ude05 thanks in advance!",

I have experienced hair loss with every flare-up of my autoimmune conditions, but it\u2019s always stopped before I\u2019ve had any bald patches etc. My doctors have always said it\u2019s telogen effluvium and that my autoimmune flares are the trigger. \n\nHowever, I\u2019m now in the midst of a serious flare of something we *think* is new. The hypotheses on the able are RA or SLE - I have symptoms that could be either/both and I have urgent referrals to get checked out. In the meantime, I\u2019m getting really distressed by how bad my hair loss is this time. I have lost what I\u2019d estimate to be 80% of my hair volume, and the rate of loss is not slowing. I\u2019m hoping getting a diagnosis and treatment will help, but in the meantime what remedies have folk tried and tested for managing this? \n\nI\u2019m already taking biotin, but I\u2019m sure I could be doing more. I have no idea if caffeine shampoos etc actually work. All help/advice very welcome. It\u2019s so hard to when illness impacts your appearance in such a significant way. ",

It\u2019s the only thing that consistently works for many. Unfortunately it didn\u2019t work for me, so then I tried shampoos and finally supplements. I still take the following: b complex vitamin with biotin, vitamin d, magnesium (it\u2019s needed for the body to absorb vitamin d), and zinc. Growing hair takes years- so try not to get discouraged along the way. I finally have growth and it is about 6 cm in length now. It looks odd considering the rest of my hair is quite a bit longer but I am grateful to see it growing. Trim hair regularly to stop breakage.  Also, do what you can to reduce stress- walking outside in nature, meditating, praying, etc. Mindfulness in whatever form you choose should reduce stress. Finally- we lose hair in cycles. The fall is when my hair is constantly shedding. Not until January does it slow down. Knowing this has helped me to not freak out in the shower every day. You can also try a hair topper to help.",

I remember the complete panic as I had a rodent sized ball of hair every day as I washed it in the shower.  It was so scary. On the positive side, mine actually just grew back (as stubbly annoying short stuff) once I had really high doses of prednisolone to control the flare (like 200mg a day).  You might experience the same thing, depending on the cause of the hair loss.  I really hope you get it sorted.  Having autoimmune medical stuff is bad enough, but I find it really upsetting when it causes permanent disfiguring things as well as disability.  this seems really unfair.",

    "text": "For those of you who have been diagnosed with dermatomyositis, what are you opinions on whether positive M1-2 alpha and beta antibodies (confirmed by two different labs six months apart) plus photosensitive v-sign/shawl sign and cheek rash (but not across nose or on eyelids) are clinically significant? Also possible mild Gottron\u2019s papules on knuckles and documented history of unexplained papular rash on both elbows every few years. Biopsies of both elbow and chest rashes returned as inconclusive to DM. Do have elevated CK and CRP.\n\nMy dermatologist saw the chest/shoulder rash at my annual skin check and asked me to check with my rheuma because he thought it looked like dermatomyositis, which I had never heard of before. My rheuma already treats me for psoriatic arthritis (with Cosentyx) and Sjogren\u2019s. I do have proximal muscle weakness, pain, and atrophy but sometimes I think that may be related to my PsA because my disease presents mainly with enthesitis---it is difficult to differentiate where pain originates and difficult to stay active when everything hurts! After seeing the abnormal M1-2s, my rheuma asked me to pause my statin in case this was an instance of drug-induced DM. However, after a month and a half of no statin, the rash has not improved. It took me nearly 8 years to get a psoriatic arthritis diagnosis and start treatment, so I\u2019m worried about another long slog to diagnosis for a new condition. I see my rheuma again this fall for additional testing but wanted to pick your brains in the meantime.",

    "text": "I wanted to share my experience for anyone else dealing with these types of aphthous ulcers, as not a single doctor I saw had ever seen this before, and I couldn\u2019t find anyone else on line with a similar experience. Hopefully this can help anyone else out there going through this. I had to really take charge of my own medical journey given the rarity of this condition, and if I had not done my own research and made my own decisions, my treatment would have been delayed months. \n\nI originally had a fever and sore throat, but over 72 hours i developed purple sloughing labial ulcers. OBGYN tested for all STIs (negative), bloodwork came back normal except for positive EBV titers for a recent infection, negative cultures and biopsy showed non-specific inflammation. \n\nGiven this, running diagnosis was lipshutz ulcers. These should heal on their own in 6-8 weeks, so was started on clobetoslol and lidocaine, both helped with the pain and to allow me to urinate. My OBGYN did weekly surgical debridements of the necrotic tissue, but the lesions worsened. (** in retrospect, debridements were a mistake, but no way Dr would have known that). \n\nThe lesions were getting worse so I was referred to a wound doctor, differentials now included pyoderma gangrenosum (secondary to possibly chrons or EBV) or bechets disease. I got genetically tested for bechets, which was negative, and I also never had eye or oral ulcers, making it unlikely. I had a colonoscopy, which was normal, so no chrons. Negative for celiacs. I convinced my doctor to put me on high dose steroids, which helped with the pain but the lesions persisted. \n\nAt this point I went to a dermatologist, who wanted to do intralesional steroids experimentally but I elected not to due to possible side effects and unclear diagnosis. He repeated a biopsy and felt convinced it was pyoderma. \n\nBased on my research, I realized I needed systemic immunosuppressants, and sought a rheumatologist. Rheumatologist started me on inflectra infusions (generic for remicade, tnf-alpha inhibitor). At almost exactly 6 weeks into treatment, my lesions started to heal dramatically, and within a month they were almost completely healed (about 6 months after this journey started). \n\nI wanted to share my story as I have seen other women post how they had these ulcers for even longer and many were never referred to a rheumatologist. I also was never told to go to a rheumatologist, I sought that care myself. \n\nI felt very alone and often hopeless during this process since my doctors had never dealt with this before, and I couldn\u2019t find anyone else with a similar experience. Even if this post finds one other person with this I hope this can help them! ",

    "text": "Hi, first time posting here, because I scoured the internet and at this point, I am at a complete loss as to what could be my problem. So I'm wondering if anyone had similar symptoms, tests results and got an actual diagnosis for... something.\n\n28F. For 3 years now, I am unable to function. Extreme fatigue - cancer patients level fatigue at times, muscle weakness, joint pain. Worst moments, I can't even walk. Exercise makes me endlessly worse, usually the day after and forward (not your typical \"sore muscles\"). My migraines - existing before - got worse. It happened suddenly, in the course of 2, 3 months. It comes in flares, gets triggered by stress, both physical and mental. I also have a butterfly rash (that appeared 3 years ago too) getting worse with triggers & flares. I've been told it's \"just anxiety\" for 2 years, got psychological treatment, felt worse and worse, until I got pissed off and set out on a journey by myself to figure it out.\n\nMy blood tests came out perfect outside of autoimmunology. ANA titre over 1:1000. Pattern speckled, chromosome positive (AC-2). **Every specific antibody I tested for was negative (including lupus)** except for strongly positive DFS70, which I already know just kind of excludes rheumatoid AI. I'm still waiting for HLA-B27 results, as I also have some back pain. I also have elevated CRP, at levels suggesting constant inflammation. Every vitamin level, morphology - all perfect. Liver perfect. Kidneys perfect. Tested for RA, negative. My cortisol glands are healthy if reactive - not enough to cause such severe symptoms.\n\nI tested positive for Hashimoto's thyroiditis, but after consulting my endo, she said I'm preclinical, and even with some experimental treatment I don't feel much better. She said my extreme symptoms can be exacerbated by Hashi flare ups, but nowhere *near* the levels I experience, not yet at least.\n\nDoes anyone else have a puzzling case like mine? I need a clue to find a specialist, since if I go to a general doctor I will get the \"get exercise, stop stressing out\" advice again. I can't function, can't work, can't take care of myself, so any tips towards additional testing or checking out some specialists will be appreciated.",
