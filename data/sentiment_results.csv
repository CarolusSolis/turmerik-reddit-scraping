jarchivistswag,"I’ve had chronic nerve pain and severe, bilateral paresthesia in both of my legs, for over a year and no doctors can figure it out. I’ve spoken with 6 neurologists about it who agree there’s no way it could be because of a few old, small herniated discs I have, but also can’t figure out what’s causing it. I can’t really sit down anymore because it makes my nerves so angry, and I really just feel shitty almost all the time. I’m on two medications for it, one that barely works and one that maybe has been helping but I just started it, so it’s difficult to say.  
I just don’t know what to do. I hate that I have to accept it but I don’t even know what’s happening. This is the rest of my life. Yes. I understand that. I feel terrible about it most days, but if I’m very strict with how I move and don’t sit or do things that make my nerves angry I can get by relatively not horrible feeling. But I don’t even know why it’s happening. I hate that I don’t know why it’s happening. I hate that maybe there could be a treatment, but I don’t know what it is, because I don’t even know what’s wrong with me. I hate that I will never be taken seriously about it by anyone because I don’t have an answer for it. I hate that I can never get on disability, because I have no diagnosis, even though just daily life kills me if I’m not living like an alien who barely steps out of line and I can’t work. I hate that my life is ruined. I’m just in such a weird place. It’s so hard to accept this when no one knows why it’s happening. My most recent neurology appointment said “we will do one more EMG and MRI of your lumbar plexus, and if that shows nothing your best bet might be clinical trials and seeing The Mayo Clinic.” What the fuck is my life? I have New York insurance. I can’t do shit anywhere else unless I’m so interesting to a researcher that they take me on pro-bono for the love of the game. What do I even do with myself? I feel so aimless. I just want to be comfortable again. Even a piece of my body is completely numb and it’s slowly spreading and I have no idea why. I constantly feel like my legs are being prickled by needles if I’m not careful and they always tingle. It’s just so distressing and overwhelming sometimes. I need to have more self restraint and stop trying to sit. I just miss my life. And myself. And how carefree everything was. I feel so fucking weird and I don’t know where I’m at. I just know my life is over, will continue to be over, and I will never be able to return to the type of carefree, physically able person I was before all of this garbage. And whenever I talk about it I’m just told that I’m depressing— that it’s depressing that I have no hope in ever getting better. But I won’t. I have to live like this and accept that it’s over. This is the only life I get. Wishing for a miracle that will never exist will get me nowhere. There is no cure. There is no way to even know what is wrong with me. But I really am just miserable a lot of the time. I got told by the person performing the repeat EMG that I was “a perfectly healthy 18 year old” based off my nerve impulses. I think I’m in hell. I’m trying my best. It never ends, though. ",Negative,0.9617137908935547
hotheadnchickn,"Hey, I am so sorry you are dealing with this. It sounds like a lot of pain on a daily level as well as limitations, and right now, no help or diagnosis in sight. 

I also have an invisible issue that caused a sitting disability and it’s a really difficult and isolating limitation. I have other chronic illness/disability stuff but for me this aspect is the most limiting and the most hard to accommodate. And it’s a limit that is hard for people to wrap their head around. I have tried to explain when I am asking about spaces and potential accommodations and people offer me wheelchairs 🙄 So you think disability = wheelchair?

The amount of ageism that the doctors give you is ridiculous.. or seeing you as a hypochondriac :/. Like I’m here to try to find help and an answer. I just want to be functional. 

Just wondering did they run the brain entire spine MRIs with contrast? And have they done a sacral mri? 

Cause my spine mris didnt show anything until they out the contrast in then they found a bunch of issues. 

When it hurts when you sit does it feel like sciatica pain? I’ve been feeling numbness in both my hands and feet, I’ve had two emgs ran one was abnormal the other was normal, my new neurologist wants to run another emg lol… and when it came back abnormal they tell me “well sometimes these tests aren’t reliable” me like : okay then why are do we keep running them…

Magicenbykat,"Tldr I'm jaded from soooo many bad/useless Dr appointments, but starting them back up because I finally have insurance again, and partner thinks I should push for diagnoses instead of just asking for treatment for pain and symptoms. I'd rather focus on addressing the symptoms bc that's given me more relief than trying to test for things my Drs don't know what they're testing for.

Basically the above, but for more context: I have no optimism about starting with this new PCP (I just moved, I haven't had a physical in 2 years because I've been moving a lot and I should get one to see where I'm at lab-wise at least) and based on not being taken seriously in the past with pretty much 100% of the doctors I've seen, I'm sort of over trying to find out what is causing my pain and *issues* and am just wanting to get treatment for my inflammation and nerve pain. I'm in PT for loose joints and in general, my PTs have helped loads more than any doctor has. I wish they were my PCPs.

I never got an official EDS diagnosis (came to that myself after research and reddit, and one sorta helpful Chiro), but was put through a ton of expensive, unnecessary, and painful testing to rule out conditions I knew I didn't have (RA, carpal tunnel, etc) before my team of doctors gave up and I never went back. Literally, my neurologist said, ""Huh, I was positive it was carpal tunnel. I can't help you hun. I guess, don't bend your arms unnecessarily?"" to me asking how to treat my forearm+hand nerve pain and sensitivity, which gets worse when I bend my elbows a lot like when I drive, type, and do pretty much everything else in life.

I've just stuck with saying I probably have a connective tissue disorder and an unknown nerve issue, plus old diagnoses for a migraine disorder and an ME/CFS diagnosis that might cover most of my symptoms because it's such an annoying condition, but that can't be cured because...it's ME/CFS and yea. (Yes I know more research is being done on it now bc of long COVID, I'm part of the clinical trial group and official condition org or whatever. That shit sucks. I will be asking about LDN though.) 

Partner thinks (and is partially right, I will acknowledge that) that I should push for diagnoses to get treatment for them instead of trying to skip and treat my most problematic symptoms. I've already improved somewhat over the years by doing things that target the symptoms (diet changes, PT, not laying in bed longer than 9 hours to avoid being crunchy), so I know it can be done but...

What I'm asking I guess is, is it worth it, and how has any of y'all's decisions regarding symptoms vs diagnoses (if this is even a thing, I know I've read it somewhere on here) has helped/hurt. Thanks in advance and for reading my rant-y, annoyed novella. :)",Negative,0.7813852429389954

TheIdealHominidae,"Hi,

Many of you suffer from the lack of diagnosis and sometimes the lack of trust from doctors or family/friends or even yourself, as to wether you really have a disease, or wether you are ""faking it"" or simply psychosomatic (an actual medical condition).

The reason for this difficulty, is that many chronic illnesses symptoms are rather unspecific, even more so at the early stages (e.g. in the case of autoimmunity), such as unlocalized pain, tiredness, etc.

I have studied the topic of cytotoxicity which is an almost universal common component of diseases and its biomarkers.

We have routine biomarkers that often allows to almost localize and or rule out entire organs, for example transaminases (and a few others) for the liver, lipase/amylase/glucose for the pancreas, creatinine for the kidney, creatine kinase for muscles and the heart, etc

While those biomarkers are excellent for the above reasons, when they shows up negative there still remains a very large list of systemic diseases.

Diseases are characterized by inflammation unfortunately CRP and ESR only shows up in a minority of inflammatory conditions.

There is another widely available biomarker, LDH, that by design quantify in a non organ selective way, the amount of cell death (because LDH is contained in every cells and is not normally present in much quantities in blood unless it leaks from dying cells)

So it is one of the closest thing we have that approximate an universal marker of inflammation and therefore of diseases. In light of this understanding, it has recently been tested on 48 diseases and found to shows up as elevated in 46 of the 48 diseases, which is impressive.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8217520/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8217520/)

The normal range is up to 153 u/L but in many conditions it is only slighly elevated in the 150s-170s a result that is often ignored despite being indicative of disease activity.

LDH serves three key purposes, 1) to observe that there is a disease activity/cytotoxicity 2) to quantify the extent of the systemic toxicity 3) to assess the effect of medications and supplements on cytotoxicity by observing or not an LDH reduction post treatment, consistently.

While LDH is not truly universal and there are many diseases where it will *not* shows up, it still is according to this study the most broad biomarker of the presence of a disease.

And in my opinion its use (complement and does not replace other biomarkers) for assessing 2) and 3) is underatted, being a direct marker of the quantity of cells death.

It is important to note that LDH is largely useless to actually diagnose *which* disease you have (unless it is extremely high) and this probably is why it is sadly underused in practice.

There are other markers that are even more universal than LDH, the markers of oxidative stress (such as malondialdehyde levels) however unfortunately those markers are a bit expensive contrary to LDH.

While I'm at it, some specific biomarkers I consider are underused:

For neurodegenerative diseases, there is a recently developped, universal marker of brain neurons/axons damage. The neurofilament light chain in CSF.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10380627/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10380627/)

It unfortunately is not available everywhere and it probably costly. Moreover while it assess for neurotoxicity and is useful for point 2) and 3), as for LDH, it usually does not allows a specific diagnosis, still their uses outlined are very useful and their broadeness in scope makes them particularly fit for people that fails to be diagnosed.

Another broad biomarker are free light chains in blood, the name is similar but their use is radically different. Except for a few conditions like amyloidosis, free light chains does not allows a specific diagnosis, however there are papers showing it often is elevated in many (most?) autoimmune diseases

such as: Rheumatoid arthritis, sjogren

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16569685/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16569685/)

lupus

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21312346/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21312346/)

etc

As for LDH, they do not allows a diagnosis, however they allows to quantify 2) disease activity and 3) the effect of medication(s)/supplements.

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24099109/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24099109/)

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21221683/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21221683/)

Free lights chains are not proven to be an universal marker of autoimmunity but it stills is the most proven biomarker to shows up in different autoimmune diseases.

Those recents scientific discoveries about correlates of old biomarkers, are in my opinion a scientific revolution for the clinical practice of chronic illnesses.

As said, while those markers won't always shows up they are the most broad ones available, they are widely available (except neurofilament), and hence is a major tool to help undiagnosed people to be considered and further investigated despite not allowing diagnosis.

Moreover the ability to monitor disease severity and to partially (doesn't replace other biomarkers and methods) quantify the reduction in disease cytotoxicity by therapeutics is an essential tool of precision medicine that can improve the quality of life and prognosises of patients and allows for fast, empirical trial and error of different therapeutics instead of blindly believing the current therapeutic combination is empirically the optimal one (maximal reduction).",Neutral,0.5953876376152039
Singing_Wolf,"Just venting. I really hate insurance companies. 

I have refractory Myasthenia Gravis. I've had it for more than twenty years. The only things that work are Mestinon and IVIG. I've tried every immune suppressant, prednisone, all of it. Some of them twice around (long periods for each).

The only other thing that has made a difference was a clinical trial of Car-T (I'll make another post about that, it was great). But it's worn off and it will take a while to get back in. 

I was recently hospitalized for a myasthenic crisis. After five days of IVIG, several in the ICU, I finally got to go home, with strict instructions to resume IVIG. The insurance company denied it as ""too expensive.""

I called and explained that without IVIG, I would, with 100% certainty, end up in crisis, not breathing, and back in the ICU.  Which is much more expensive, I promise. 

Their response?  ""Well, hospital stays are covered.""

I hate them so much. 

Between my neurologist and myself, we did eventually get them to cover it, but it took way to long, and the pharmacy had to agree to write off the amount in excess of what insurance will pay for. I still hate them.

vaporwaveroses,"I have a condition that has virtually no treatment options, and I’ve exhausted all the ones that exist (both on and off the books). A bit ago my doc ask if I wanted to sign up for a trial for a new medication and I was super excited and immediately agreed, because there’s been only 1 fda approved treatment for it to come out ever (surprise surprise it didn’t work for me). I then get told a while later I can’t do it because I have a functioning uterus and the trial doesn’t want anyone with the possibility of getting pregnant to participate because of the threat the medication can pose to a fetus. I’m denied a potential game changer for me because of a hypothetical pregnancy.

MamaRackley,"So, this week I got two new doctors.  Ugh!  I made a pact with some colleagues to start taking care of our health and doing our annual exams in November 2019.  At that point I hadn’t seen a doctor other than for emergencies in decades.  I was told all my blood work came back bad after my physical and they wanted to recheck it to confirm.  It was confirmed that I had diabetes and high cholesterol and was out on meds.  My liver numbers were all bad and I was sent to a hepatologist.  That came back that I have NAFLD/Nash and was at the door of cirrhosis.  I got put in a clinical trial.  I had many GI issues over the next year and intestinal infections.  Then, the sponsor pulled the clinical trial, my hepatologist retired, and my GI had a baby and decided not to come back.  So, I went on the hunt for new doctors.  Found a good GI, they got me on meds that helped my stomach issues.  I got accepted at a patient at Duke for my liver stuff and I am currently being screened for a new trial.  I was referred to a rheumatologist to see if they could help with inflammatory and spine issues and was diagnosed with non-radiographic axial Spondyloarthritis and started on biologic injections.  Now, I have some issues with my oxygen levels randomly dropping during the day.  They se t me for a chest X-ray that came back fine so I got referred to a pulmonologist.  I have no idea what is happening there but I can’t get in until February 17.  Then I keep having passing out spells so I got referred to sleep medicine and had a consult with them and have a series of tests that are being done now.  Oh, and I was just walking in October and two bones in my foot snapped.  They put me in Vitamin D that was severely low but my bones won’t heal and now I have special shoes and a bone growth stimulator that was ordered.  I have to do that for two months and if it doesn’t heal they will have to go in and re-break my foot in a way they can fix it because where the breaks are they don’t have enough surface area to put plates and screws.  Ugh!  I am nervous about the upcoming tests.  I am wondering when I will be considered disabled and have to go through the SSDI process.",Negative,0.6989166736602783
fishfanaticfun,"Feel free to skip to the TLDR if you don't want the long story. 

I got diagnosed with POTS this year but I knew there was more than POTS going on. I recognized I have been having a dryness issue for a while now. I literally flakes off all over my arms if I use any kind of soap on it and essentially after a lot of trial and error I've learned to wipe them off as best as I can and use a moisturizer. This also led me to realize that my eyes are dry, like to the point of dramatically affecting my vision. 

So I saw a doctor. Who ran a test called SS-A. It's a Sjogrens antibody test and it came back negative. I saw an eye doctor who tested my vision before and after treating dry eye issues with preservative free eye drops, hot compresses, and massaging a gland near the eye. Turns out, my vision improved by like 30 on both sides. They initially thought I would need eyeglasses and was actually driving illegally because of my vision being so bad. Gross, but turned out not to be true. They gave me a prescription for glasses because I've developed near sightedness and a stigmatism. Okay fine cool. Will the dry eyes ever go away or am I stuck with this eye routine forever? Doc doesn't know. I get the SS-A re-ran just in case. 

I pointed out that some sjogrens patients never test positive for SS-A because I researched it myself after it came back negative the first time. All the doctors I talked to after this are like ""yeah that's true but it's the only test we have"" so I'm like what the heck do I do now? I guess not worry about it since they aren't worried? I don't have dry mouth really. Just dry eyes.

Except two months after this I got diagnosed with MCAS. After finally getting it under control the swelling in my mouth is gone... But my mouth is incredibly dry not that the swelling is gone. I have a constant level of annoying pain and discomfort from the dryness. So I messaged my physical therapist who initially found MCAS. He sends me a crap ton of resources about sjogrens. Yeah turns out that the SS-A test only comes back positive after you've hit a certain point of progression in the disease... Which is why it's rare for people under 40 to get diagnosed. I'm 25, I don't want to wait 15 years for treatment for something that I now know because of the resources my physical therapist sent me can permanently damage your mouth, eyes, and other parts of your body. So I'm like dang. Why the crap has no one taken this concern seriously when I've brought up concerns about it?

Well turns out there's additional tests they can run. It's called the early sjogrens antibody panel and they even listed three or four additional tests that can be helpful for diagnosis but are less specific to sjogrens. So guess what? Now I have to make a doctor's appointment and convince a new doctor that I'm meeting for the first time to order me tests they've probably never heard of! Yay! 

So I did exactly that. I brought the resources from my physical therapist with me and I sat down with the doc and he was like yeah, never heard of these tests but I have heard of POTS and how a lot of conditions appear with it. So I show him the resources and go over the tests with him. The healthcare network I'm going to is THE BIG ONE in my area. The prestigious hospital and clinics. I'm talking the ONLY level 1 trauma center in the region! Like they service other states, like five other states besides my state. Literally people come for over six hours away to get care here because they have all the crazy specialists who specialize in the nitty gritty stuff. And guess what? They only have the nonspecific tests. They have SS-A and SS-B but nothing else sjogrens specific. 

Being me I know there are other labs around. LabCorp and Quest aren't that far away. So I asked him to print out an order for the tests he couldn't get for me within his own health system (which in my opinion REALLY SHOULD HAVE THESE TESTS). I take that order and go to LabCorp who literally has the same exact tests the big Hospital health system I was just at had.  LabCorp is nationwide. Why the crap don't they have it? I take my order and leave. 

I look up Quest and I find the exact three tests that I still need listed under a test code on their website. Hallelujah I've found it! So I go to Quest and it just happens that there's only one employee there because of call outs and understaffing so they randomly can't take walk-ins. Yowch. She tells me to schedule an appointment and come back tomorrow. Alright, bet. I show her where my number is on the order and I tell her to call me if she has any questions because I've had trouble getting the test done. 

So yeah about an hour later she calls me this conversation happens:

""We don't have this test, we have the one LabCorp and the big Hospital have""
""nah you have it, I found it on your website, let me pull it up, one second"" 
""I doubt it, I even called and asked my coworker who is really good at the test stuff and she says this is the only one we have""
""I found it, it says it has the SP-1, PSP, and CA-6. I have a test code, would you like it?"" 
""Wait, which one did you say it had?""
""All of them""
Pause
""What's the test code?""
""######"" (I don't remember the number lol)
Pause
""Oh wow! It has all three of them right there together in one test!""
""Yup""
""Okay well I'll get this in and we will see you at your appointment!""
""Awesome thanks, bye""


Like.... Just like.... Why???

To add a bit of context I used to work in healthcare and I input labs as part of my job. I think my background in this is the only reason I will be able to get the tests. Like gosh dang! What a nightmare! All for a condition that can literally attack organs in your body and cause some real awful permanent damage to you. I'm shaking my head at this and I'm also mad because I'm positive my physical therapist sent those resources to other people too and that they haven't been able to A) convince a doctor to order them to begin with B) convince them to order them despite not having the tests or ever hearing of it before C) know which labs are nationwide so you know you can check with them D) know how to check with the labs without help from staff because they don't know they have these tests

I see my physical therapist tomorrow and I'm going to show him exactly how to get his patients this test. I see a more specialized cardiologist doctor in December who's so high up on the PhD chain that he meets with the board and the president of all the medical stuff for the whole hospital system. I know he's awesome already because my physical therapist reached out to him to get a medication prescribed and he called me and then prescribed it after talking to me despite never seeing me in the clinic. So I will be making a stink with him that they should frickin have these tests because I'm not the only one who needs them. 

Also Quest has officially outcompeted LabCorp in my book, and has won over my business and support. Quest is awesome, despite their workers not knowing things. 

Oh and a fun tidbit, the doctor who ordered the tests was genuinely shocked they hadn't run one of them on me before. He said it should be ran for POTS patients especially when they have CFS like I do because it's an autoimmune disease. If that test comes back with any abnormal markers I get a rhuematology referral! So fun!


TLDR: I've seen multiple doctors about my dry eyes that could be sjogrens, they ran one test and gave up on it, they never told me that this disease can really permanently harm your body, and now that I got more info from my physical therapist of all doctors I had to see a new doc to get the lab ordered and I visited three labs today trying to get this done and have only ran into problems",Negative,0.5657150745391846

nicole-96,"Most pathways to diagnosis are a joke. They run a basic test, tell you ""oops, it's negative"" and then they move on. Meanwhile, you still have the exact same symptoms you've been having and zero answers. It's like, they think that just because something comes up negative that their job is done. Also, they gatekeep the hell out of tests and scans, for what reason? The logic of healthcare sometimes isn't logical at all. 

For example, I have a vertebral body hemangioma. Most of the time, they don't cause any problems, sometimes, they spontaneously rupture and you can become suffer serious neurological effects or die. So... I asked my doctor about it. She tells me ""Oh, they're usually symptomless and never cause a problem. They really only become a problem if they grow. But, it's not something we typically monitor"" M'AM IF YOU DON'T TYPICALLY MONITOR IT, HOW DO YOU KNOW IF IT'S GROWING??? Like, that's basically like saying ""Yeah, it can kill you if it grows, but we're not even going to check if it's growing... so... basically, if it kills you, it kills you."" 

Same goes for my thyroid nodule. Doctor tells me ""I don't think an ultrasound is necessary because thyroid nodules are common and usually not a problem."" Cool, but I have a family history of thyroid disease and thyroid cancer... so like... scan please?? I had to beg her to write me a script for a thyroid ultrasound. It was already recommended by two other radiologists on reports for other scans I've had for different issues. Both scans picked up the nodule and the first radiology report noted ""A follow-up with dedicated sonography may be necessary"" and the second radiology report said ""A thyroid ultrasound is highly recommended."" Like, if the radiologists are recommending a scan, obviously they don't think it's just a common normal thing. Otherwise, they would just say ""Common finding"" or something like that.

potsandmm," My name is Bryn and I am a Clinical Research Coordinator at Massachusetts General Hospital.  I am looking for volunteers in New England to enroll for a clinical trial to investigate how medical cannabis can affect opioid use and pain. The goal of this study is to see whether medical cannabis might help people reduce their dose of opioid medications, while receiving support from clinicians to manage pain.

 Participants will receive up to $1,130 in payments, which are made monthly following the completion of each study visit. We are looking for people who:

1. Are 18-75 years old
2. Use prescription opioids for chronic pain
3. Do not regularly use cannabis
4. Are located in New England

The study will involve 3 components:

1. A weekly Prescription Opioid Taper Support (POTS) group, where you will work with trained clinicians to learn pain management skills and create an individualized opioid reduction plan to match your goals. Groups meet weekly for 26 weeks over Zoom.
2. Daily surveys, where you will be asked to complete a short (1-2 minute) survey on your phone each day to help keep track of your pain levels, medications, and health.
3. 8 study visits, which are completed over 6 months, and can be done in person or via Zoom. Day and evening appointments are available.

 Many people think that medical cannabis may help with pain management or opioid medication reduction. This trial will help determine whether medical cannabis is helpful or not in patients with chronic pain on prescription opioids. You decide what types of medical cannabis products, how much, and how often you use. Medical cannabis and medical cannabis certificates will not be provided directly by this research study.

 If you are interested in this study and want to learn more, please fill out this short prescreening survey here ([https://redcap.link/5n90qllp](https://redcap.link/5n90qllp)), and we will contact you if you are eligible to participate.

Impossible-Vanilla75,"**TL;DR:**

I’m a Canadian permanent resident living in Norway with a complex medical condition requiring specific medications. Financial strain and isolation mean I need to move to Ontario for family support, but Canadian healthcare restrictions on narcotics and GP shortages make this challenging. *Please read the full post for a complete understanding as it’s a complex case. I need advice/solutions—please share any insights/ ideas rather than just sharing how bad the system is or that I shouldn’t move. :( Your time is much appreciated.

**Full Post:**

Hello everyone,

I’ve been living alone in Norway for the past 6-7 years and have found Norway’s welfare system functional, though not perfect. I moved to Oslo in 2017-2018, and by 2020, my health started declining. Last year, my condition worsened, and I became bedridden. I managed to work full-time until my August 2023 surgery, after which my health deteriorated further. Unable to manage alone, I went to Canada for Medical Assistance in Dying (MAiD) approval, as I am a Canadian permanent resident.

The main reason I’ve stayed in Norway this long is due to sickness benefits, which covered my salary for a year. Unfortunately, my employer unfairly terminated me due to my illness, and while I sued for severance, I still lost out on sick pay after the 11-month mark since I didn’t have an employer afterwards. I recently applied for work assessment allowance, but was denied, and it would take 7+ years to qualify for permanent disability. Now, without income or a support system, staying in Norway is unsustainable, even though the welfare system has helped me immensely otherwise. 

In Norway, I’ve been able to establish trust with my doctors and receive the treatments I need, including various medications that manage my pain. My condition, largely related to Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS), has required extensive and complex treatment since a lot of severe complications, including an entire damaged pelvis arose from it. I even temporarily turned down an extremely expensive surgery for my specific condition, offered by the top specialist in Switzerland through the Norwegian government, due to the risk of worsening my condition. My current medications include:

**Daily Medications:**

	•	Oxycodon3 (Immediate-release, 10mg, 2-3 times a day)
	•	Paracet@mol (4 times a day) 
	•	Ox@zepam (25mg, 3 times a day) 
	•	Baclof3n XR (25mg, 3 times a day)
	•	Ambien (10-20mg, once at night) 
	•	Elv@nse for ADHD and to counter sedation (30+30 morning and evening) 

**For Breakthrough Pain / Emergency Use:**

	•	Morphine injections (10mg) delivered by a home nurse
	•	Fentanyl patches (50-75mcg)
	•	OxyContin (20mg)
	•	Valium (10mg)
	•	Chlonazepam (2mg)
	•	Clonidine
	•	Additional non-narcotic medications
       •    Buprenorphine patches 50mg 

* I don’t usually take the second list at all, except for chlonidine to knock myself out.*

My specialist wanted me to try Levo-methadone next, as they’re aware of my history of not picking up medications from the pharmacy, my aversion to opioids due to their side effects, and their limited effectiveness at times. The pain clinic noted in my records that I didn’t want an increase in my opioid dose, so they couldn’t assist further.

I take just enough oxycodone to manage symptoms (twice a day)—keeping my laxatives effective, reducing the intense burning in my pelvis and feet, etc. Although they recommended 20-30 mg of oxycodone, I refused that amount. Overall, I appreciate Norway’s relatively functional medical system.

My family lives in Ontario, Canada. Despite the need for support, I didn’t previously attempt to move there because my brother was concerned about the quality of care in Canada compared to Norway, where ER services and doctors have been supportive. As my condition worsened, they never denied my referrals or even fast tracked it. I also have private healthcare insurance, so when public queues are long, I can see the same doctors privately, though this does come with its own challenges.

Overall, Norwegian specialists never accused me of addiction as I’ve always gained their trust by not mixed meds, or picking up meds from pharmacy, or being extremely anxious of taking opioids all alone due to low pulse rate and BP. So they have given me the necessary medications after numerous trials and finding limited efficacy in other options. I have refused increased doses, wanting only enough relief to manage daily pain and side effects. Atm, Oxy is the only opioid that works if taken in moderation (2x a day). If I increase its loses its effectiveness. 

As my condition worsened, they never denied my referrals or even fast tracked it. Tried giving me an inpatient ket@mine trial too, but it didn’t work. I also have private healthcare insurance, so when public queues are long, I can see the same doctors privately. 

**Why I Want to Move to Canada:**

The Norwegian system, though supportive, cannot provide me a support system even though they do have some schemes, but it’s not the same as what family can do for you. At this point, I want to live with my family who can help me with daily tasks like cooking, eating, errands, love, care and support. However, my brother fears I won’t get a GP in Ontario due to the shortage and long wait times. He’s been trying to informally talk to GPs he knows, but they’ve all told him that I need to come and register for OHIP and after looking at my lengthy records, they can answer that question. 

OHIP informed me that I must register for health insurance and apply for a GP, but during the wait (which can last for roughly a year), I can only be out of Canada for a month. The biggest hurdle is that Canadian customs limits schedule 2 narcotics to a one-month supply, even for terminal patients. The person I spoke to at customs was blunt and unhelpful, and OHIP couldn’t provide alternative options and said “when you run out of meds, you can do what the rest of the Canadians do. Go to the ER and hope for the best”. Walk-in clinics don’t prescribe narcotics, and the ER is notoriously slow and inefficient as most Canadians can vouch for. 

Without access to medications, I can’t survive, let alone work remotely to support myself and keep myself busy. *My Norwegian doctors are even willing to prescribe a six-month supply to ease my transition and write a detailed letter of my situation, something almost unheard of here due to the possibility of drug abuse and selling drugs on the street, but Canadian customs still restrict it and said even if you’re dying, we can’t let you in with narcotics for more than a month.* my doctors suggested they could adjust dosages on the labels to extend usage, but I’m not sure how long those would last. Maybe two more months, but not more. 

**Questions for Ontario Residents:**

	1.	Does anyone know of a GP in Ontario who is accepting patients, is understanding and might continue my prescriptions while collaborating with my Norwegian doctors?
	2.	Is there a faster way to get a GP given my complex medical needs?
	3.	Will I need to redo my medical assessments for complex diagnoses in Canada, wait for years (the luxury of time that I might not have) to get referrals and dismissed, or would my Norwegian and European records suffice?
	4.	Is there any way to legally bring in more than a one-month supply of my essential medications during this transition? Maybe through the US, like keep it at a trusted friend’s place in NY and bring it every month? 
	
**Questions for US residents/citizens, especially New York:**

• Would the American doctor, specialist or clinic, no matter how expensive that might be, serve as an option for continuity of care to a non-US resident/citizen? I have been to NY to see a specialist name he prescribed me diazepam for suppositories for 3 months. My partner went to Mayo Clinic, Cleveland and other famous hospitals in 2017 when he had a complex spinal condition (still does) and they prescribed him all the opioids under the sun. However, my US friends from support forums tell me that it’s extremely hard to get access to opioids, even for them who are in palliative level care. Only a few people lucked out, but they go to doctors that I might not be able to see as a foreigner since they only accept insurance patients, I assume. I have another doctor in Arizona who was willing to prescribe *an* that I wanted to try, but he said I’d have to travel all the way to Arizona, otherwise he license might get confiscated. Does anyone have recommendations within the US healthcare system while I find decent doctors in Canada?

I always have the option to travel back to Norway for new assessments, or prescriptions to try, but I can only do this like twice in a year. 

I can’t stay in Norway due to financial, social, and other challenges, and I need my family’s support. I’d deeply appreciate any insights from those familiar with Ontario’s healthcare or anyone who has faced similar challenges. **Thank you so much** for taking the time to read this – understanding the full scope of my situation is crucial, as it’s highly complex and nuanced.

afterglow-ed,"I don't even know where to start. My life plummeted into a downward spiral and I feel like I'm in a nightmare that I'll never wake up from. This is an extremely long post, so I don't expect that many will read it. But I'm hoping to get some personal comfort from the catharsis of putting this nightmare into words instead of holding it inside.

**TL:DR**

I experienced extreme pain (level 10) down my cervical and lumbar spine and had to go to A&E. I got hospitalized while the orthopedic doctors investigated my spine with x-rays and a MRI. Eventually, I was diagnosed with cervical spondylosis which triggered a slipped disc. I'm now in constant pain, fear and helplessness. The doctor said I would be better in 3 months once the slipped disc heals but I'm worried that my life will never be the same again, and that I'm in for a life of chronic pain. It's hard trying to accept that I have a degenerative disease with no cure. 

I'm not coping well, but I'm trying to be brave. Any encouragement would really, really be appreciated.

  
The rest of my post is just me detailing all the things that brought me here. Feel free to skip. 

----------------------------------

**Events leading up**

I am an avid gamer and crocheter. So, I did the stupid thing where I gamed for hours and hours after FFXIV's newest expansion launched. This lasted for a month. The second month, I decided to take a break from the game and prepare to rent a stall for a crafter's charity event with my friend. This resulted in me crocheting like a fiend for 1 month straight. 6 to 8 hours a day, with short breaks for lunch. And of course, I ended up in a shrimp-like posture while bent over the table.

My nightmare first manifested in the form of thumb tendonitis that quickly led to tennis elbow on my right side. Losing the ability to use my right hand properly was horrible and I had to compensate with my clumsy left hand. I couldn't sleep because of the pain, and often flipped and turned, sometimes even pushing myself off my pillow with my neck in frustration because I couldn't utilize my elbows properly. I'd also toss and turn, and contort myself into strange positions to try and fall asleep. Eventually, this led to a week of an extremely sedentary state where I spent most of my time on my recliner because there was nothing I could really do without severely triggering the pain in my elbow. Somewhere along the way, my neck started to ache, and my trapezius muscles kept bunching up.

So there you have it. A series of bad decisions and mistakes, and even at this point, I thought my tennis elbow was my greatest physical trial. What an idiot I was.

**The beginning of my nightmare**



**Oct 1** - Then, it happened. Last Tuesday, I fell asleep with relative ease compared to other days. I remember thanking God so profusely as I drifted off to sleep because I just felt so peaceful and comfortable. I fell asleep on my right side. Hours later, I half woke up and decided to change positions so I wouldn't put too much pressure on my tennis elbow. So I turned on my back, didn't like how that felt, and turned again to lie on my left side. Immediately, this HORRIBLE pain resonated at the back of my neck (L4 - L5 region) and I jumped out of bed, yelping in pain. It was at least a 6 to 7 on the pain scale. I immediately ran for a cold compress. Eventually, the pain lessened to a 2 and I decided to try going back to sleep. Nope. The moment I lay down, the pain started escalating again and I had to get up.



**Oct 2** - I went for a neck x-ray the next day and found out that I had mild cervical kyphosis and some wear and tear in the L5-L6 region where they had been compressed to the point where there was very little space in-between. I thought it was the kyphosis that was causing the pain. I started googling methods of stretches that could relieve kyphosis, such as chin tucks. Through all this, my neck hurt like crazy so I had to stop and I decided to get a physio referral the next day.



Night fell, and it was horrible. I couldn't lie down at all. I spent the night trying to lie down, finding out that I couldn't, getting up and doing a hot compress to see if it would help. I took 2 anarex. It barely dampened the pain. It was a full night of fear and pain. Eventually, I think my body shut down and I managed to fall asleep for 45 minutes before the pain woke me up again. I think it was the longest night in my existence.



**Oct 3** - I went to the doctor to get a referral for physiotherapy. She took a look at my x-ray and proclaimed, ""this is not a normal neck."" And basically made the situation sound so horrible that I really just felt so hopeless. She asked if I had done a lumbar spine x-ray and said that she wouldn't be surprised if there was damage there as well. After a full night of insomnia and pain, this really just triggered my depression. I did get the physio consult, and for a blessing, it was on the same day.



At the physio session, the therapist actually assured me that the kyphosis wasn't actually some life altering thing, and that some wear and tear in the cervical spine was normal and could be handled with some stretches. I felt very comforted and left the clinic feeling more hopeful, even though my neck was still at a constant level 2 to 3 of pain.



The thing is: I have a tendency to pain catastrophize. This happened throughout my tennis elbow incident so I thought the neck pain was the same thing. I think I basically gas lit myself into thinking that I was exaggerating the amount of pain I was feeling and that if I didn't think about it, the pain would go away.

----------------------------------------

**Hospitalization**



**Oct 3 Midnight** - I decided that this amount of pain wasn't normal. By this point, I had not slept since the night the neck pain first woke me. After trying to lie down and discovering that every position caused the neck pain to escalate, I decided to go to the A&E. I thought that I'd just have the doctor check me out and give me some peace of mind.

On the way to the hospital, the painkillers I took wore off. I'm not sure if it was a combination of being jostled during the ride, but the pain in my neck started escalating and radiating down my spine to my back and tailbone, and over my collarbone. I dug my nails into my skin while gasping in pain. By the time we reached A&E, I could barely walk because I was trembling in the most extreme pain I had ever felt. It was beyond a 10 on the pain scale. My blood pressure was at 160 and rising and they immediately wheeled me into critical care. I begged for painkillers while tugging at my hair. Eventually, they gave me every painkiller that wasn't morphine and I slowly felt my panic dissipate as I fell into a drugged out state. It was like my body had become a shell and I was trapped inside. But through all this, the pain fell to an 8 and I could feel it. But I couldn't respond to it. It was horrible.

  
**Oct 4** Eventually, they told me that I had to be warded for observation. I felt relieved, honestly. I thought the doctors would find out what was wrong with me, they'd fix me and this pain will go away. And I'll be okay.

Thus began my stay in the hospital. The lead doctor came by and told me that they thought two things were the cause of my pain. Firstly, he suspected a trapped nerve caused by the lack of space between C5-C6 and / or a herniated disc. They arranged for more x-rays of my lumbar spine and a MRI for both my cervical and lumbar spine. I was put on pretty strong painkillers and that helped me to finally fall asleep.



**Oct 5** The hospital's physiotherapist came by and taught me some neck exercises. I was asked to do some basic things like looking to the left, right, up and down. I could do all this with a decent range of motion, but it really triggered the pain. Eventually, she asked me to look up and hold the position for 20 counts. This caused me so much pain that I had to stop. I think she eventually realized that I wasn't ready for physiotherapy yet and told me not to do the stretches if they caused pain.

I was quite afraid at this point. I had been told that physiotherapy would be a key thing to improving my situation. But it hurt so badly. I tried to comfort myself, thinking that perhaps the pain was currently at the acute stage and I needed to let it heal a little.



**Oct 7** The day of my MRI scan arrived. I was terrified because at this point, even with the painkillers, I could barely lie on my back for a minute before the pain got too much to bear. How would I survive 1 hour in the MRI machine?? My mental health at this point was at a all-time low and I had spent the past few nights just sobbing in fear.

One of the nurses caught me crying and I think she must have said something to the doctor because the lead doctor came by hours before my MRI. I told him about my trepidation and uncertainty if I could lie on my back throughout the MRI scan. He decided to give me a shot of pethidine just so I could get through the scan. And it actually worked. I ended up completely inebriated and actually started humming and singing because the world started going up and down. I think I slightly scandalized the MRI techs because I kept asking if I had to remove my bra and panties, and kept trying to show them that my bra had no metal underwire or clasps.

^(.... I decided never to do narcotics henceforth. \^\^''')

But I did appreciate that little bit of humor and levity. I ended up sleeping through the MRI scan and when they pulled me out, I utterly refused to let go of the panic button. One of the techs had to gently prise it from my grasp. I was so out of it, but it actually felt nice because the fear was temporarily lifted.

That night, back at the ward, was by far my favorite one. The effects of the pethidine were still in effect, but the vertigo went away so I was just left with this delicious sense of levity and good humor for a couple of hours. I actually felt normal again, just slightly tipsy but in a really good way.

-------------------------------



**The diagnosis**



**Oct 8** - I was awakened by the junior doctors around 8am. I was actually excited to hear what plans they had to help fix my situation. Finally, they knew what was happening and they would help me.

This is what the female doctor said:

>""Yeah, so the results are out. What you have is spondylosis. You know what that is? The degeneration of the spine? Yeah. You have that. Are you ready to be discharged today?""

I literally felt my world collapse around me. Even as my panic built, she mercilessly just continued and told me to inform the nurses if I wanted to be discharged so they could process it and they left. And that was it.

No help. No hope. I would never be the same again. That was all I could think about in that moment.

I went into full panic mode and frantically pressed the call button. I didn't even know what to do but I knew that I couldn't be alone. A nurse came in and immediately asked me what was wrong. I told her what the doctor said and she started to reassure me that there could be ways to live with this, and that I wouldn't be in perpetual pain. She calmed me down and promised she would try to get the doctors to come back.

Finally, the lead doctor came by, with the junior doctors in tow. I was barely holding back tears, and to his credit, he sat down and asked me what he could do for me in such a patient and gentle voice. I asked him if this pain was something that I had to live with for the rest of my life, to which he went, ""No!"" He then told me that the cause of such extreme pain was a herniated disc, probably due to the compression between my C5 and C6. He assured me that the inflammation would subside and the pain would dissipate within 3 months. I then continued to tearfully asked about my spondylosis and whether I was doomed to a life of pain. He said that my condition could be maintained with physical stretches and exercise once the pain from my herniated disc heals. I did have to make some lifestyle changes (no more hunching over my desk like a shrimp for long hours, no high impact exercises) and I had to wear a soft cervical collar to prevent myself from looking down.

I asked if I had to sleep in a certain way, and he assured me that if I was going to injure myself further, it would be while I was awake and not while I was asleep. He knew I had been battling some insane insomnia during the pain, and told me that I should just find whatever position was comfortable so that I could sleep, and my body could heal. I told him about my suicide ideation because of the sleepless nights full of pain and he swiftly told me, ""No no no. Don't think like that. It's like a car has a punctured tire and instead of just changing the tire, you scrap the whole car. No. You will get better."" Then he told me he would write up a psych referral to help deal with my depression.

------------------------------------  


**Where I am now**

I'm not sure if he was saying all that to be kind, and that my condition is actually more serious. But right now, I'm just taking things one day at a time and trying to stay positive. It's my second day of being discharged from the hospital. I'm at home, and it feels surreal. Everything in my house is the same. But I'm not. I'm afraid of the future. I'm afraid of not being able to ever carry and cuddle my beloved dog again. I'm afraid that I took my life and health for granted, and this is my body's way of punishing me. I'm afraid that I will never be able to travel again, or even to go to my favorite shopping mall. I'm regretting all the trips that I never took, all the times I should have exercised, but was lazy and chose to be sedentary.

I really want a second chance to live normally again. But I don't know if it's possible. I guess I'll have a better idea once the pain from my herniated disc subsides this time.

I'm highly traumatized, especially from the sleepless nights filled with pain, and the excruciating night at A&E. I don't really know how to work through this trauma. I'm trying to just stay positive, to accept and lean on the support and love that my loved ones are offering me. But I do feel so very much alone in this. I'm honestly envious of them and their lack of degeneration in their spine. I do keep asking - why me? I think I'm experiencing the stages of grief and mourning my old life and self. Because I don't think anything will ever be the same again.

I had a good life, up to this point. A really good one. And I'll miss it. But for the sake of the ones who love me, and for my own sake, I'm going to try and be brave. I'll rest and recover, and when I'm in a state of lesser pain, I'll work hard at physiotherapy, maybe get a personal trainer to help teach me exercises that I can do to strengthen my core and build some muscles to protect my spine.

I think. There's a good life, a full life for me, even with cervical spondylosis. I have to believe that.

I (25F) have Interstitial Cystitis (constant, never ending pelvic/bladder pain) and I am having a hard time finding a doctor who will care about my pain and help manage it. I’ve tried pretty much everything except narcotics. My doctors are not willing to prescribe. The pain doctor I saw was fine with doing a Hypogastic Nerve block (didn’t help me) and she even offered to do a Spinal Cord Stimulator, which hasn’t really been studied on IC patients. But she won’t give me any medication. It’s not an issue that I’ve wanted to push and I try to be very careful with doctors as I don’t want them to think I’m drug seeking. But I feel that nobody deserves to live in this kind of pain constantly. It makes me insane. Despite this, I continue to try everything I can to get this pain to go into remission. I am actively trying many things even clinical trials. But in the meantime  I need something to get me through. I have no quality of life, and I am miserable all the time. Does anyone have a recommendation for a pain doctor that will help me? I live in Dallas, Texas.

royalnoodles,"Sorry for what you’re dealing with. Can’t recommend a pain doctor as I live in Ohio, but there may be some medications you can explore. If your pain is nerve related, an SNRI(cymbalta, etc.), TCA, or anticonvulsant(Lyrica, gabapentin) could be something to maybe try and be easier to get. I have some weird undiagnosed testicle pain and doing pelvic floor therapy, and Cymbalta and Lyrica have provided some relief but not enough unfortunately. Could just be something to try in the mean time. I know how hard it is. Too many visits and being referred to other specialists and going in circles.

I would research complex pelvic pain specialists in your area and see what you can find. In my experience, a lot of pain clinics have little experience with pelvic pain or simply don’t treat it. It’s a grossly under researched and undertreated problem. I haven’t got there yet unfortunately but you may just have to find that one doctor who’s actually willing to do a deep dive on your issue and get you the help that you need. Sorry about all this.",Negative,0.6215279698371887
iusedtoski,"I don't have a recommendation for a pain md in that area, I'm sorry.

A couple of things:

First, I'm recently finding that it seems there are specialists in pelvic pain and they might reside in urogynecology, not in standard pain mgmt practices.  These people aren't even that well known to the pain management clinics I've tried.  These clinics will say ""pelvic floor therapy?"" or ""have you talked to your gynecologist"" and maybe if that person is a PCP they might not know about this specialty either ... so I figured I'd mention it.

I could see that maybe a pain mgmt practice could have one of those specialists on staff. However, in my experience (5 clinics so far maybe?), pain mgmt practitioners that one might encounter in a hospital's ""pain clinic"" seem to have only spotty knowledge of this area.  The ones I've met have been more coming from a background of general anesthesiology or neurology, and seem to be most solid in the areas of arthritis / spine / limb neuropathy / CRPS and stuff like that.  Anything to do with the specifics of the uro or the genitals and a lot of them are somewhat lost.

Second, as it happens, I met with a urogynecology pelvic pain MD today in my area, and I mentioned the TENS treatment for neurogenic (spasming) bladder.  She knew of it.  I've been using it to relax muscles in my deep gluteal but it's used for bladder, and for spasming in other areas.  All these areas are served by nerves that come from the sacral plexus, which is apparently why it works for all of them.

I just looked it up and it seems to be a treatment for IC, too.  Here are a couple of links showing at least some promising results.  I've read other links that give much higher response rates for some issues for structures served by these nerves, I mean above 75% success.  \[edit: and it might be possible that it's that successful for IC, too.  There is some indication that anecdotal reports are stronger than what research has been able to pin down\].  And of course the TENS electrodes are totally non-invasive.  As long as one doesn't have a syndrome that rules out their use, like fibrillation or epilepsy, of course.  But I use mine on and off throughout the day and even to fall asleep, and I have seen research showing that that's fine too.

BeardedGrizzly1,"Hi there!  I've been smoking cannabis on and off since around the age of 14 and I'm now heading swiftly towards hitting 44, so a good part of 30 years.  I didn't touch anything from 2018 to 2021 as the company I worked for did random drugs testing. (I worked on the roads for A Plant LUX as a cone fairy). Anyway .. in 2020 pre lockdown, I had an accident which triggered a load of underlying problems to crawl out from under the rocks.  To cut a long story short, I now have several chronic conditions and a total of around 16 ailments.

I decided to start smoking cannabis again to help with the pain.  I didn't use any opioids from the Dr as I don't like how I feel on them and they're addictive.

I found out that you could legally get cannabis oil and flower on private prescription from ten different specialist clinics, as part of the ""UK's clinical trials for medical cannabis"".

I use a special ""Dry herb vaporiser"" to take my medication.  I have a travel one as well as two mains powered ones.  All three are made by Storz & Bickel.  They aren't cheap and neither is my prescription, if I'm honest!
  I use my PIP to pay for my medication bill of £420pcm.  This gets me 40g of flowers at 24%THC  <1CBD, then 30ml of cannabis oil at 20%THC 10%CBD. Both from Curaleaf clinic.

And yet... Because ""weed"" has such a bad name and having massive misinformation & propaganda spread around.  I sometimes get people passing comment in public if they catch a whiff.  I know that they may not know it's me, but I could do without hearing ""don't people know it's illegal?!"" or ""It's a bit early in the day for that!"" ""There's kids over there and people with families""... Yeah, I'm a person with a family just trying to discreetly live my life, lol.

If the doctor said to some of these people ""I can offer you two choices, either a medical vape that you load with Cannabis throughout the day, or a shot of Morphine twice a day?"". They would choose the Morphine, the most addictive and closest related to Heroin that you can get via the NHS. 🤷🏻🤦🏻

Does anyone else get made to feel awkward for taking medication, especially prescribed cannabis?",Negative,0.6170934438705444
Lirathal,"Yes.


To extrapolate more, I live in a country where it is legal for recreational use. Unfortunately, now people think it’s a choice, and not medicine. So for example, if I need medicine (Cannabis) while out at the park with my kids, I get looks and people snicker. I use a dry herbal vape (Arizer Solo II) and use a “Sploofy” which is essentially a carbon air filter I breathe in to, no icky smell comes out, no smoke, zero. The Sploofy helps, if you act like you’re supposed to be doing it, other people will follow along. If they complain, I launch in to the tirade about how I use it under a doctor’s advisement for my health conditions and when they stop discriminating against me anytime they like. Conversation dies right there. Like I said, make sure you “act like you are supposed to be doing it” and have the data to back it up. cheers",Negative,0.4787321984767914
Fair-Yellow5772,"I feel so angry even as I’m writing this. My pain management clinic since I’ve been with them already under treats my pain because of the whole “opiates are bad” campaign and it’s super funny how so many other people are on them there but for me ohhh nooo can’t correctly treat my pain. 

I was finally making some headway; I came from Kaiser being on 40 mg total of norco per day 10 mg basically every 4-5 hours. Kaiser cut me off for no reason all because I kept trying to push to please try cortisone shots. I am not and have never been an addict just severe pain from my herniated disc, degenerative disc disease, spinal stenosis all in the l4-l5/s1 etc. It took me over a month from switching from Kaiser last year to get into this pain clinic. The first thing was they would only give me tramadol, not great but better than ibprofuen. 

I switched through like 4 other doctors within the pain clinic because they have multiple locations and one is super close to my house, but after literally all others acting like I was drug seeking, I went back to the first doctor who prescribed the tramadol and told him I only didn’t come back immediately because of the drive being further and I was hoping some of the doctors by my house would be good. 

Well anyways after 6 months and a new mri showing the herniation getting huge, he was like yeah I definitely believe you’re in pain. And he wanted to try RFA since the cortisone injections didn’t help. And he switch the tramadol. To 2 5 mg norco per day. And I don’t want to seem like a drug seeker so I was like but DAMN that’s still barely anything. I don’t expect to get back to 40 mg but 2 10s per day would probably control my pain at least by the end of the day when it’s at its absolute worse. 

I got by barely while we tried the diagnostics still in severe pain most of the time. The two diagnostic trial for the RFA actually seemed to work. Like I didn’t feel any pain for the rest of the day of procedure for the first time, and I would not have felt pain the second time because the good doctor from that clinic also said that since we know the first one “worked” he didn’t want me to feel pain and so on top of concious sedation he gave me fentanyl. Again for like the entire day i felt great until it wore off. 

Since the procedure itself two weeks ago, I’ve been in severe pain. Also my good pain doctor left the clinic so I don’t know what’s going to happen this month on the 23rd. But I’ve been super suffering and they keep telling me give it time up to 3 weeks but now I have no hope this helped at all and I’m in serious regret like my worst pain most days hovers around 8-9 and I’m at 10 every day since the procedure. And they’re not taking me seriously when I leave messages. I’m not having a fever/signs of infection at the injection site so I don’t think it’s infection. 

I hate everything. Also last month right before he left he refilled my medicine and they were out of 5s at the pharmacy so they called me back and said the pharmacy had 10s and I was so hopeful since I talked about my bad pain they’d give me 2 of those per day.

DaydreamerDamned,"I'm 24. I lost my insurance a year or two ago and moved to another state with equally shitty, if not worse, free healthcare options. I just want to rant about the state of things because life feels fucking impossible right now. No advice please, but if you have a similar story, please feel free to share it.

Prior to losing insurance, I was being evaluated and treated for:

* Constant back, neck, and shoulder pain caused, at least in part, by hypermobility and small, constant muscle spasms
* My joints painfully popping and feeling as if they were sliding out of place
* Asthma
* Assumed Vocal Cord Dysfunction due to previous testing from an ENT who told me the required testing would be extensive, but that that was the dx that best fit the symptoms in his opinion (but no treatment for this, it just should be on the record somewhere)
* Racing heart
* Lightheadedness
* Weight gain not explained by lifestyle choices
* Insomnia
* Anxiety
* ADHD

I was in the process of getting an official autism diagnosis, and had already received testing from my therapist, who agreed with the dx. I had also \*finally\* found a therapist I really, really clicked with. I was in physical therapy up to 3x a week. I was also about to see a cardiologist (about my heart) and a neurosurgeon (about my spine). And then I lost my insurance.

I have been on Medicaid my whole life. Medicaid is the reason I had access to healthcare at all. At some point they changed the criteria to exclude young, able-bodied adults who made less than the earning requirements, but they ignored many cases who had already been approved. Eventually, they decided to finally go through all those cases, and I was a part of the many who got booted from the system with no warning. I'm still shocked and so thankful I managed to get my wisdom teeth removed before losing my insurance. If I ever find out it wasn't covered somehow and that bill ever comes back to me, I would have literally no means to pay it whatsoever.

I am very invested in my health, but without insurance, I have no means to take care of it anymore.

Since losing insurance, I have done a TON of research and have had a lot of pieces fall into place so that I am \*fairly\* confident I know what is going on, or at least what ballparks to be searching in. But no insurance means no chance at even attempting to get diagnosis.

I don't and can't work. I apply to every position I think I could force myself to tolerate, particularly if they offer insurance, but I never hear anything. And if I'm being honest, I know I can't really handle any of the positions I apply for at this particular stage in my health journey anyway.

I am dealing with subluxations daily. My neck is currently either subluxed or bulging or pinching a nerve, I can't tell you exactly, but I can tell you that it feels like one wrong move would paralyze me.

This is an injury I sustained from literally just laying my neck on a foam roller. \*NOT rolling my neck on it.\* Just laying on it. I genuinely thought I was going to have to be lifted off the floor and taken to the ER that night. I still don't know how I managed to peel myself off the floor and get to bed. This injury felt like it was healing, and when it finally got to a point where I couldn't really feel it anymore, I yawned and stretched one morning and reactivated it.

I literally get injured from stretching. From laying on foam rollers. From sleeping. I am a very strong person! I used to weightlift, and I currently really want a pull-up bar and weights to use at home. But my bones \*will not\* hold themselves together correctly, so unless I am incredibly slow and mindful about my movements, I \*will\* injure myself.

So, I'm well aware at this point that the government doesn't care if I end up homeless and die. I'm lucky to be living with a partner who financially supports me, but they and their family still need me to work, and so I'm still trying to find it. Plus, without access to healthcare, I have no means to explain why I feel so awful all the time, so no one understands. Labels might not be the world, but they do grant you access to a level of understanding you don't have otherwise, and that goes for trying to get others to understand what you're going through as well.

Idk. It just feels so fucking hopeless and isolating to be in pain all the fucking time, with no way to explain it, no one who understands, and everyone still expecting you to function normally. Ideally, I'd be receiving disability benefits so I can work more on my own terms, and I'd have access to healthcare and the treatment I need.

And it's frustrating having this conversation, even with people who care and want to understand, because often the suggestion is ""sliding-scale clinics"" or something similar. But like, here's a simplified version the process that would need to happen to get any definitive answers or diagnoses:

I scrape the money together to go to general physician > describe issues > they order bloodwork (that I can't afford), prescribe a medication (that I can't afford) to help manage symptoms and/or refer me to one or more specialist/s (that I also can't afford) > if I can choose one, I'll see a specialist, who will also need to see labs and run tests, and likely will need to see at least half a dozen other specialists in other fields and take all their required tests > lengthy process of testing and finding potential treatments for symptoms with lots of trial and error > regular follow-ups to check in and monitor progress > additional testing when necessary > a never-ending cycle of care because health is forever evolving.

So, without free healthcare with no/minimal co-pays, seeing a doctor for issues they aren't qualified to test for or treat is a waste of time and money, and also a guaranteed trigger for a flare-up just due to the stress alone.

So I constantly try to educate myself using what free resources I have, but it's exhausting learning all this medical terminology, all the ways of identifying, testing, and treating the things I suspect I have, and knowing I have access to none of it. I can't even afford to eat a diet that doesn't cause flares, how the hell am I supposed to invest in my health when it's locked because a paywall? A paywall I will likely never be able to afford to cross because the job market is crap and I'm too disabled for anything that requires more than 2-3 days a week to begin with.

Old-Goat,"You really gotta find some insurance. Just a single test can pay for the yearly premium. Its not so much for the doctor, but all that other stuff that comes with a medical issue. Healthcare.gov is no help? Sometimes a hospital will have a free health fair, you may want to try those, too. Dont make the mistake of using the ER to figure this out, those docs are not trained to treat the kind of health issue you describe. Unless you have a recent gunshot wound, the ER isnt going to be much help.

Are you familiar with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome? Its a collection of hyperflexibility conditions. Lots of subluxing, lots of dislocations. I dont think there's much they can do for the hyperflexibilty issue other than strengthening and conditioning the connective tissues, which in turn can cause subluxing and dislocations, so you need to be careful doing it.

A lot of docs will work with you if your insurance doesnt cover them or if youre self pay. They will often cut you some slack on the billing if you talk to them.

Work is tough. Telemarketing/phone support is usually something you can do from home working your own hours. Try[these guys](https://www.ntiathome.org/) I'm pretty sure they have been around for quite a while.

One thing Id suggest looking in to on line is relaxation techniques. Pain patients live extremely stressful lives, even if theyre fully insured.  Deep breathing is usually a big part of it. You actually want to breathe from your belly, not your chest. Bringing in more 02 is actually a relaxant. Thats why one of the !st things they do is get a patient on oxygen. It makes them quiet. I dont know if you recall it, but Oxygen Bars were a big fad for a while. Grab a soda and huff a couple liters. But youre also making other metabolic changes, like reducing your adrenaline production. Thats real helpful, if youre trying to relax.  You are in a stressful situation, so it shouldnt be much of a surprise you feel the way you do. That does not mean you shouldnt do something about it if you can. Usually I tell folks to seek a pain psychologist, but the last thing you need is another medical bill, for now.

Hang in there. When you get discouraged by the medical system, take a look at what the folks in the UK are saying about free healthcare for all. That doesnt work either. Canada's hybrid insurance system seems to suck, too. I hear Cuba has good health care....",Neutral,0.4691721200942993
spineissues2018,"It's been a rough patch with the neurosurgeons. (Fused cervical and Lumbar - scoliosis) After a team clinical review twice, they have decided against going with the T10 to Pelvis fusion. The value add for the invasiveness didnt match so we jointly agreed that it doesnt make sense. They feel that my kyphotic neck (reverse curve) is causing a large part of sagittal imbalance. I am falling frequently and have broke some teeth etc, shit is getting old and it hurts really bad because my body is in spasms from trying to correct the imbalance.  They would like to fix the neck surgically, but that will require them to re-break my neck to change the curve. After peer reviews with the team, the decision was to not do this due to the risk reward. They did confirm that my bilateral radiculopathy and bilateral Poly sensory neuropathy is nerve damage and there is no recourse other than implanting two hi frequency SCSs.  I am going to waiting and see on the SCSs. I did a trial on one unit a decade ago and it sucked. Not seeing a huge percentage of people saying they love it and it was worth the surgery and scar tissue to do it. Love to hear from others.

My former pain clinic started me on sublingual buprenorphine (a generic for Subutex) last year and it works really well for me. I'm on 2mg every 8 hours, along with a short acting opiate, membrane stabilizer and muscle relaxer. Due to pressure to agree to interventional procedures that I'm not comfortable with (like a C1 laminectomy for a stimulator trial!!!), I opted to transfer care to a different practice. At the same time, I've started having issues with my teeth, so I asked the new provider about transdermal patches. She thought it was a good idea and prescribed what I thought was a 5mg patch, but is actually a 5 microgram/hour patch.  

My concern is that I'm transitioning from 6 milligrams per day to 12 micrograms (edit: 120 micrograms) per day, which is an enormous dose reduction. I've been trying to research absorption between sublingual and transdermal routes, but haven't found much data comparing the two as Subutex is primarily used for OUD, rather than pain management (I had no idea about this, unfortunately.)

Compared to SL buprenorphine which has a bioavailability of about 25% this would mean of that 6mg per day only 1.5mg is actually getting absorbed.

This pain is characterized by a ""pulling"" sensation on my right side. It feels as if my testicle is hanging on a too short string that becomes tense when I sit. When I stand, I have no issues.

After my surgery, I tried various things. Firstly, I revisited the urologist. An MRI was performed, which showed nothing abnormal. The urologist suspected that a nerve was damaged during the surgery and that I would have to learn to live with this pain. Then, at the pain clinic, some trial blocks were performed by an anesthesiologist and I was prescribed Lyrica, unfortunately with no effect. I also tried a TENS machine, again without success.

My new PCP here is managing my Pregabalin, but I was interested in doing a spinal cord stimulator trial. So, I had my appointment and got a feeling for the clinic and see if it was a good fit. Ultimately, I decided to go back to Mayo as I just feel more comfortable there with any further procedure. Still, I contacted the pain clinic and let them know what I decided and completed a release to get my visit note.

Shortages of opioids and other medications reached record levels in the first quarter of 2024, according to the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists. Opioid litigation and cuts in DEA production quotas appear to be responsible for some drug shortages.

PNN columnist Dr. Forest Tennant shares some of his recent findings about the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which appears to play a role in many cases of chronic and intractable pain.

Investigators in Australia found little evidence that spinal cord stimulators help treat chronic back pain. Some patients have more pain after getting the devices.

Got TMJ? People with chronic jaw pain often have surgery to reposition or even replace their jaws. The results are often disappointing.

In a small clinical trial, patients suffering from severe spinal cord injuries improved after injections of stem cells. One patient paralyzed from the neck down is even able walk again.

Aavaox,"Update: I got butt hole botox! lol it’s fun to say. I also found a medication that’s commonly used for lower pelvic muscle relaxation called Flexril, and it has dramatically improved my quality of life. Turns out I have a condition called EoE, but it seems to affect my entire digestive system. It’s a low grade allergic reaction that’s constant. It lines the digestive tract with eosinophils which are allergy cells, which make the channels of the tract more and more constricted with exposure to the allergens. I can still only eat very little foods, but a very hard elimination diet has helped, along with weekly shots to help with the inflammation. The flexril helps to relax the muscles in addition to only eating safe foods. I landed myself in the hospital and nearly died from malnutrition and that’s what started this whole fiasco. In addition to a blood clot in my groin which potentially lowered the blood flow to the area, causing more swelling. Bowel movements still cause some pain, but it’s more of a 3-4 instead of a 9/10. I can walk around and am generally more independent now. I’m off the narcotic pain meds, and I can work now. Looking back on this post makes me wanna hug my former self. She had no hope. I wanna thank everyone who commented with solutions and support. It greatly helped me at the time and still means the world. Thanks for everything, and I hope those who still struggle can find hope that with time it WILL get better if you don’t give up.
Fr guys, check out flexril, the positive effects have been incredibly helpful through this, and it’s a common medication we missed out of all the meds we tried for pelvic pain. 


TLDR: life is ruined by chronic butthole pain 
I’m sorry this is a long one, partially a cry sesh, and a call to not be so alone. Even if you can’t relate, I think I just need some kind of emotional support. The pain I have is literally constant, there is no way to relief other than to sleep, and I can’t sleep until exhaustion because of the pain. It’s so overstimulating, I’m bedridden, my days are the same, I’m on psych meds AND in therapy and im at that point I know you all know so well when you’re not sure if it’s worth being alive for this quality of life

I have a GI complication from a bowel resection performed hours after birth, which has caused me 23 years of chronic diarrhea. I’ve shit minimum 6 times a day basically my whole life. I’ve spent any time not shitting, strongly clenching my Spincter muscles unconsciously in order to not shit myself while living daily life. Over time, my Spincter muscles have become hypertonic. Theyre just permanently tensed. I’ve also had some sexual trauma in that area which has created this psychological connection to some of the muscle clenching as well. 
Almost 3 years ago I started having random rectal pain. Like when you get your period and you get those electric shocks but mine would last SO long. Over time they became more and more frequent and last longer. I’d go to the ER because they’d last for an hour or two, it being associated with bowel movements. Having a doctor perform a digital exam forcing the muscles open was honestly traumatic. Pooping was painful before and especially after because of the spasms. it would feel like there was a ball in my anal canal. I’m talking 9/10 throwing up on the toilet screaming out loud suffering. I’d have to sit in a hot shower or a burning sitz bath for relief. 9 months into this whole fiasco,  every time I had a bowel movement, I would have to lay down for 2 hours and mentally distract myself until the pain would go down to tolerable level and then I could stand. Occasionally I’d have a GI flare up and spend the entire day at a 9/10 pain, stuck between shitting, laying in bed and laying in a burning hot bath just crying. After 2 years of seeing a primary, seeing GI, having all of the tests done, being hospitalized multiple times, misdiagnosed with nerve pain, fibromyalgia, “it’s just your trauma and ptsd”, so SO many different psych medications with all their dangerous side effects, psychotherapy the entire time, meanwhile the situation gets progressively worse. Finally my GI sits me down and says “there’s nothing clinically wrong with your rectum. So the best I can do is prescribe psychical therapy and psychotherapy, the obvious answer is PTSD.” 

I spend 4 months with a pelvic PT doing vaginal muscle releases and exercises that don’t seem to be helping anything at all.
 Comming up on year 3. I don’t leave my house, I eat the exact same super healthy organic diet (less than 10 ingredients, no unhealthy comfort foods), I do my PT exercises, I take all my medications as prescribed, and I spend my near every waking thought thinking about the pain, how to avoid the pain, when it will be the worst, dreading every single bowel movement, the pelvic spasms come at all hours of the day, my Spincter muscle is so tight event a fart hurts 7/10. 
I can’t sit up right. Standing hurts, sitting hurts, laying on my side hurts the least. 
Last week my PT told me I have Levator ani syndrome which is a chronically hypertonic pelvic floor. 
My pelvic floor muscles don’t relax fully, and my rectal muscles are permanently flexed as hard as possible. Mental stress is absolutely connected to it as well. (This I had already noticed) Pain meds don’t help, muscle relaxers don’t seem to help. Exercises don’t help, I have a good connection with my nervous system, and relaxing my nervous system doesn’t help, meditation doesn’t help, hot bath doesn’t help (it’s ritual at this point) diaphragmatic breathing doesn’t help, releasing trigger points seems to make it worse. 
With this syndrome treatment is pretty individual to the sufferers body, and it just takes time and trial and error to find what works. I’m relieved to finally know it has a name and get started on the journey of finding what works for me, but right now i feel so unbelievably alone. Levator ani sydrome has robbed me of so many things, it affects every aspect of my life and no one even knows what it is.

AccomplishedScale362,"I’ve been a nurse since the early 70s. I’ve seen so many practices and drugs/products come and go. Here are just a few examples…

-When I first worked in hospitals, everyone smoked—patients and staff. The nurses’ station was under a continuous cloud of cigarette smoke, with overflowing ashtrays everywhere. Doctors would do rounds with a cigarette hanging out of their mouth.

-In order to rid newborns of those dirty vaginal secretions/s, we gave them their first bath in Phisohex soap. One day in the mid 70s, we were told “don’t ever use it again” (neurotoxic, I think). Also, I once cared for a woman in preterm labor on an alcohol drip.

-Also in the 70s, we sometimes gave actual placebos for breakthrough pain. Typically for the young men with ortho trauma who spent weeks in the hospital on narcotics. Docs would order: *Normal Saline, 1 cc IM, PRN breakthrough pain*.

-The opioid epidemic began in the early 70s with Demerol, which we gave to everyone in mod-severe pain. We were alarmed when they came back to the ED repeatedly asking for “three hundred milligrams of Demerol”. But then we got OxyContin…Also, so many non narcotic/NSAID drugs have come and gone, with all the crappy merch that came with every new drug. We had a Vioxx wall clock in our dirty utility room for many years, long after the drug had killed patients and been recalled.

-For many years, just about every COPD exacerbation in the ED was put on an aminophylline drip (with all that smoking there was so. much. COPD.) Sometime in the mid 90s, I went on vacation for a few weeks, when I came back IV aminophylline was gone—one of our most common drugs. It wasn’t long before Pharma was advertising (I’m not lying)—*aminophylline thigh cream*—to get rid of cellulite! We joked that they must have found themselves with warehouses full of aminophylline and some marketing genius said “Let’s make it into a cream and have people rub it on their cellulite. We can run a few studies!” LOL!

The biggest practice change in my career was wearing gloves. With the exception of procedures requiring sterile technique, we did everything—even wiped butts, without gloves.

I was assuming that as a physician clinical knowledge is pretty important if you wanted to keep practicing, but if you switch to a research job and never did any true clinical practice are you basically locking yourself out of the clinical aspect?

finnoulafire,"I am not a physician but work in clinical research and have worked with a number of experienced and novice Principal Investigators on the conduct of trials.

Based on where you are at in terms of knowledge of clinical trial operations, if you are interested in working in clinical research as a site investigator:

* I STRONGLY recommend finding a group practice or hospital setting with an established clinical research program in your setting. Eg, the group has at least 2 or 3 clinical research coordinators working on 6-10 clinical trials; the trials include some interventional trials (not just observational or bio-banking); the trials include some industry sponsored / FDA regulated trials (not just Investigator initiated or academic grant funded)

* I STRONGLY recommend finding a mentor who currently operates at least 2-3 industry sponsored clinical trials in your practice area

* I STRONGLY recommend starting out by working with that mentor as a 'sub-investigator' on a couple of their trials

* Expect that it will take 2 or 3 years of gradually assuming additional responsibilities on trials before you are really 'ready' to lead a trial as a Principal Investigator. This is primarily due to the fact that most clinical trials have long life-cycles, and gaining experience requires work during the start up, implementation, subject recruitment, subject follow-up, and trial closure phases of a trial.

* Some small Sponsors may be willing to work with you as a Principal Investigator without much prior experience. Unless you have a robust team of investigators and clinical research nurses / coordinators around you, this is not recommended. 

About half of physicians who attempt to become Principal Investigators in industry sponsored trials quit after **one trial** [see this article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S245186541630093X)

This is because until a novice physician works on their first trial, they really do not understand the workload involved. They do not understand that the bar is higher than routine clinical practice.

Calavar,"Bigthama already raises some great points. Adding on:

> Hello all, out of residency and setting up my job... Assuming that a starting career in clinical research as a PI

As Bigthama said, working towards PI is usually a path that people start in medical school and continue through residency (and fellowship, if applicable). If you're on this path, you should have already checked off some boxes by the time you are out of training:

* You went to a residency (or fellowship) program that was heavily research oriented, published a few first author papers, and made some connections within your specialty's academic community
* You prepared K grant applications before you completed residency (or fellowship). Hopefully you already have a grant in hand.
* Your first job is an academic job with protected research time. Preferably something in the realm of 80% research time

If you haven't checked these boxes, you can't easily segue into being a PI. You would have to go back to training and complete a fellowship with a heavy research focus.

> Assuming that a starting career in clinical research as a PI pays the same

It doesn't. This is the first thing to be aware of. There is less money in research. Maybe a lot less, depending on how well your clinical specialty is reimbursed.

> If you switch to a research job and never did any true clinical practice are you basically locking yourself out of the clinical aspect

No, you are not locking yourself out. Generally it's much, much easier to move from research to clinical practice than it is to move in the opposite direction.

There are some caveats: If you completed a research heavy residency/fellowship, that usually involves sacrificing clinical time to fit in more research time, and for procedural specialties that can mean that your case numbers drop. This won't lock you out of clinical practice by any means, but it might make you less versatile as a proceduralist.

> what’s the key difference in lifestyle

It's a matter of perspective, and it really depends on your specialty and your personality. Research comes with the headache of a perpetual funding rat race and a constant grey cloud of uncertainty (what happens if you don't get the next grant). That's really stressful. On the other hand, it's a very different stress than loads of call and showing up at the hospital to handle 3 AM emergencies. If your specialty is heavy on that sort of thing, reducing your clinical hours and call to add research/admin time might be a lifestyle friendly move.",Neutral,0.5122671127319336

forlornucopia,"TL;DR version - does negative electric charge at wound site actually aid healing? If so, are wound care clinics actually using this method?

I was recently reading a book of short stories and essays about various things, mostly sort of fringe science/paranormal stuff that would typically be considered ""mumbo jumbo"" (the book was recommended to me by a friend, i wouldn't have picked it out to read on my own, but i find myself to be entertained and intrigued by it). But then i read this paragraph about a scientist in the 1970s who successfully got amputated animal limbs to grow back with use of a negative electric current. The author doesn't cite any sources for all the grandiose claims so at first i was like ""no way, this is too big a claim"", i.e. ""proof or it didn't happen!""

So then my curiosity was piqued. I did a quick google search for studies about negative electric currents and limb regrowth and wound healing. And darn it if this hasn't actually been shown to be true in randomized trials. Of course, the author sensationalized for dramatic effect, but it seems that wounds tend to have a negative charge about them when healing, and if you apply a negative charge from outside it seems to make wounds heal faster. No studies have yet shown a negative charge to help a mammal regrow a lost limb, but there have been studies showing that mice with amputated limbs could be induced to ""sort of start"" to regrow a lost limb, i.e. some additional bone and other tissue growth at a nub but without actual limb regrowth.

What i'm really surprised about is that this seems to be well established scientific knowledge, that we have known about since the 1970s or earlier. But i don't remember hearing anything about it in medical school, and of all the patients i've referred to Wound Care, none of them ever had batteries attached to their chronic wounds as far as i know. So why not? Is it that it doesn't really work as well as the studies suggest, or that people aren't aware of the effects, or that there's some severe side effect or something?

PT wound focuses on interventions vs nursing wound care which mostly focuses on dressing changes. 

Reimbursement dropped suddenly about 10-15 years ago for these procedures. To the point where 15 minutes of Estim for wound care is like a $20 service and so most places stopped offering it. Even though the research supports it. Medicare don't care with their fee schedules. 

Same thing with compression, serial debridement, NPWT,  pulse lavage, ultrasound MIST, UV light treatment, maggot therapy, and iontophoresis. All of which are evidence based and have a significant impact of wound healing outcomes. 

Since these are all procedural the drop in reimbursement made the therapists who were doing it too expensive. 


I was lucky enough to work as a wound care PT in a level 1and got to do all of the above stuff. It was so cool and legit saved lives. I had to quit because they refused to pay us more than $36/hour and my loans are too much for that salary.

I'm a PhD and was asked to present at a conference in a session specifically meant for clinicians on a specific class of side effects following gene therapy. CME credit will be given for attending the lecture. I am confident in my knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of these side effects. However, I am not a physician, so while I can talk about what has happened in clinical trials when when these side effects occurred (what course of action the physicians took), my knowledge when it comes to tests and drugs is somewhat limited. I know the big ones that would apply, but that's about it.

I also have to turn my slides in ahead of time and have them approved by the medical school this session is sponsored by, so obviously want to make sure I do them correctly the first time.

I'm open to any and all suggestions you have for how to make this lecture helpful to you.

I see many patients with Friedreich's Ataxia, a devastating genetic condition that had no treatment options until FDA approval of Omaveloxolone this year. Omav showed clear benefit in clinical trials in slowing disease progression. The trial design used the modified Friedreich's Ataxia Rating scale (mFARS) to track progression.

The medicine is roughly $300K a year out of pocket (I think the price is also outrageous but that's a different fight). 

Anyway, since approval I've had patients be denied this medication because they are non-ambulatory (even though non-ambulatory patients were included in the trial) and also been told that I need to document the patients mFARS score in my clinical notes.

Here's the thing about the mFARS, its requires special certification to administer and at least 25 minutes of extra time to carryout. I'm not certified in this scale as no physician would be expected to have this certification unless they were actively carrying out a FA clinical trial. 

It really seems like requiring the documentation of a rare scale requiring special certification should be illegal in denying patients coverage for this medication.

The FDA approval makes no mention of scale cut offs, nor does the prescribing information, so I feeling like these companies are over-riding the FDA's decision by adding stipulations not stated in the FDA approval. Any real/practical solutions to fight this?

>  
>The lamb was one of eight in a 2017 artificial-womb experiment carried out by researchers at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) in Pennsylvania. When the team published its research in April of that year, it released a video of the experiments that spread widely and captured imaginations — for some, evoking science-fiction fantasies of humans being conceived and grown entirely in a laboratory.  
>  
>Now, the researchers at CHOP are seeking approval for the first human clinical trials of the device they’ve been testing, named the Extra-uterine Environment for Newborn Development, or EXTEND. The team has emphasized that the technology is not intended — or able — to support development from conception to birth. Instead, the scientists hope that simulating some elements of a natural womb will increase survival and improve outcomes for extremely premature babies. In humans, that’s anything earlier than 28 weeks of gestation — less than 70% of the way to full term, which is typically between 37 and 40 weeks.  
>  
>The CHOP group has made bold predictions about the technology’s potential. In another 2017 video describing the project, Alan Flake, a fetal surgeon at CHOP who has been leading the effort, said: “If it’s as successful as we think it can be, ultimately, the majority of pregnancies that are predicted at-risk for extreme prematurity would be delivered early onto our system rather than being delivered premature onto a ventilator.” In 2019, several members of the CHOP team joined a start-up company, Vitara Biomedical in Philadelphia, which has since raised US$100 million to develop EXTEND.

HHMJanitor,"Important to know that remission is the key goal in treating a depressive episode because a response alone is very likely to result in a relapse. While psilocybin separated from placebo for a response, it did not do so for remission. For comparison, pretty much every standard oral anti-depressant separates from placebo when looking at remission (https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(17)32802-7/fulltext#sec1). It's apples to oranges as far as study design, but a single dose of psilocybin seems to not meet the important threshold in actually preventing relapse (i.e. remission). Also important to note this study is not looking at the far more common psychedelic-assisted therapy.

toledozzz21,"When I started my Child and Adolescent Psychiatry training in the 2010s, the diagnosis and treatment of gender dysphoria were rapidly becoming controversial in the field. Doctors and nurses who had spent decades on inpatient adolescent units, usually seeing one gender dysphoric child every 4-5 years, now saw multiple transgender-identifying kids in every inpatient cohort. It was a rare patient list that did not include at least one teenager with pronouns not matching their sex.  
   
Viewpoints about this differed, with every student, resident, fellow, and attending having their own perspective. All of us wanted what was best for patients, and these discussions were always productive and collegial. While I am not naive about how heated this topic can be online, I have only ever had good experiences discussing it with my colleagues. Some of my attendings thought that this was merely a social fad, similar to Multiple Personality Disorder or other trendy diagnoses, like the rise in Tourette's and other tic disorders seen during the early pandemic and widely attributed to social media. Others, including myself early on, thought we were merely seeing psychological education doing what it is supposed to do: patients who would, in earlier decades, not realize they were transgender until middle age were now gaining better psychological insight during their teen years. This was due to a combination of increased tolerance and awareness of transgender people and was a positive good that shouldn't necessarily raise any red flags or undue skepticism.  
   
During my outpatient fellowship year, I began to suspect a combination of both theories could be true, similar to ADHD or autism, where increasing rates of diagnosis likely reflected some combination of better cultural awareness (good) and confirmation bias leading to dubious diagnoses (bad). Confirmation bias is always a problem in psychiatric diagnosis, because almost all psychiatric diagnoses describe symptoms that exist along a spectrum, so almost anyone could meet the DSM5TR criteria for any condition, so long as you ignored the severity of the symptom, and people are often not good at judging the severity of their own symptoms, as they do not know what is ""normal"" in the broader population.  
   
I considered myself moderate on these issues. Every field of medicine faces a tradeoff between overtreatment and undertreatment, and I shared the worries of some of my more trans-affirming colleagues that many of these kids were at high risk for suicide if not given the treatment they wanted. Even if you attribute the increase in trans-identification among teens to merely a social fad, it was a social fad with real dangers. If an influencer or spiritual guru on social media was convincing teens that evil spirits could reside in their left ring finger, and they needed to amputate this finger or consider suicide, the ethical argument could be made that providing these finger amputations was a medically appropriate trade of morbidity for mortality. ""How many regretted hormonal treatments, breast surgeries, or (in our hypothetical) lost ring fingers are worth one life saved from suicide?"" is a reasonable question, even if you are skeptical of the underlying diagnosis.  
   
And I was always skeptical of the legitimacy of most teenagers' claims to be transgender, if for no other reason than because gender dysphoria was historically a rare diagnosis, and the symptoms they described could be better explained by other diagnoses. As the old medical proverb says, ""when you hear hoofbeats, think horses and not zebras."" The DSM5 estimated the prevalence of gender dysphoria in males as a range from 0.005% to 0.014%, and in females as a range of 0.002% to 0.003%, although the newer DSM5TR rightly notes the methodological limitations of such estimates.  
   
Regardless, most of the symptoms these teens described could be explained as identity disturbance (as in borderline personality disorder and some trauma responses), social relationship problems (perhaps due to being on the autism spectrum), body image problems (similar to and sometimes comorbid with eating disorders), rigid thinking about gender roles (perhaps due to OCD or autism), unspecified depression and anxiety, or just gender nonconforming behavior that fell within the normal range of human variation. It seems highly implausible that the entire field of psychiatry had overlooked or missed such high rates of gender dysphoria for so long. Some of my colleagues tried to explain this as being due to the stigma of being transgender, but I do not think it is historically accurate to say that psychiatry as a field has been particularly prudish or hesitant to discuss sex and gender. In 1909 Sigmund Freud published a case report about ""Little Hans,"" which postulated that a 5-year-old boy was secretly fixated on horse penis because of the size of the organ. I do not find it plausible that the next century of psychoanalysis somehow underestimated the true rate of gender dysphoria by multiple orders of magnitude because they were squeamish about the topic. In fact, the concept that young girls secretly wanted a penis was so well known that the term ""penis envy"" entered common English vocabulary! Of course, the psychoanalytic concept of penis envy is not gender dysphoria per se, but it is adjacent enough to demonstrate the implausibility of the notion that generations of psychoanalysts downplayed or ignored the true rate of gender dysphoria due to personal bigotry or cultural taboo.  
   
Therefore, for most of my career I have been in the odd position of doubting my gender-affirming colleagues, who would say ""trans kids know who they are"" and talk about saving lives from suicide, but also believing that they were making the best of a difficult situation. In the absence of any hard outcome data, all we had to argue about was theory and priors. I routinely saw adverse outcomes from these treatments, both people who regretted transitioning and those whose dysphoria and depression kept getting worse the more they altered their bodies, but I had to admit this might be selection bias, as presumably the success cases didn't go on to see other psychiatrists. I could be privately skeptical, but without any hard data there was no public argument to make. The gender affirming clinicians claimed that they could correctly identify which kinds of gender dysphoria required aggressive treatment (from DSMIV-TR to DSM5 the diagnosis was changed to emphasize and require identification with the opposite gender, rather than other kinds of gendered distress and nonconformity), and even when they were wrong they were appropriately trading a risk of long term morbidity for short term mortality. There was nothing to be done except wait for the eventual long term outcomes data.  
   
The waiting ended when I read the paper ""Psychosocial Functioning in Transgender Youth after 2 Years of Hormones"" by Chen et al in the NEJM. This is the second major study of gender affirming hormones (GAH) in modern pediatric populations, after Tordoff 2022, and it concluded ""GAH improved appearance congruence and psychosocial functioning."" The authors report the outcomes as positive: ""appearance congruence, positive affect, and life satisfaction increased, and depression and anxiety symptoms decreased."" To a first approximation, this study would seem to support gender affirming care. Some other writers have criticized the unwarranted causal language of the conclusion, as there was no control group and so it would have been more accurate to say ""GAH was associated with improvements"" rather than ""GAH improved,"" but this is a secondary issue.  
   
The problem with Chen 2023 isn't its methodological limitations. The problem is its methodological strength. Properly interpreted, it is a negative study of outcomes for youth gender medicine, and its methodology is reasonably strong for this purpose (most of the limitations tilt in favor of a positive finding, not a negative one). Despite the authors' conclusions, an in-depth look at the data they collected reveals this as a failed trial. The authors gave 315 teenagers cross-sex hormones, with lifelong implications for reproductive and sexual health, and by their own outcome measures there was no evidence of meaningful clinical benefit.  
   
315 subjects, ages 12-20, were observed for 2 years, completing 5 scales (one each for appearance, depression, and anxiety, and then two components of an NIH battery for positive affect and life satisfaction) every 6 months including at baseline. The participants were recruited at 4 academic sites as part of the Trans Youth Care in United States (TYCUS) study. Despite the paper's abstract claiming positive results, with no exceptions mentioned, the paper itself admits that life satisfaction, anxiety and depression scores did not improve in male-to-female cases. The authors suggest this may be due to the physical appearance of transwomen, writing ""estrogen mediated phenotypic changes can take between 2 and 5 years to reach their maximum effect,"" but this is in tension with the data they just presented, showing that the male-to-female cases improved in appearance congruence significantly. The rating scale they used is reported as an average of a Likert scale (1 for strong disagreement, 3 for neutral, and 5 for strong agreement) for statements like ""My physical body represents my gender identity"" and so a change from 3 (neutral) to 4 (positive) is a large effect.  
   
If a change from 3 out of 5 to 4 out of 5 is not enough to change someone's anxiety and depression, this is problematic both because the final point on the scale may not make a difference and because it may not be achievable. Other studies using the Transgender Congruence Scale, such as Ascha 2022 (""Top Surgery and Chest Dysphoria Among Transmasculine and Nonbinary Adolescents and Young Adults"") show a score of only 3.72 for female-to-male patients 3 months after chest masculinization. (The authors report sums instead of averages, but it is trivial to convert the 33.50 given in Table 2 because we know TCS-AC has 9 items.) The paper that developed this scale, Kozee 2012, administered it to over 300 transgender adults and only 1 item (the first) had a mean over 3.  
   
These numbers raise the possibility that the male-to-female cases in Chen 2023 may already be at their point of maximal improvement on the TCS-AC scale. A 4/5 score for satisfaction with personal appearance may be the best we can hope for in any population. While non-trans people score a 4.89 on this scale (according to Iliadis 2020), that doesn't mean that a similar score is realistically possible for trans people. When a trans person responds to this scale, they are essentially reporting their satisfaction with their appearance, while a non-trans person is answering questions about a construct (gender identity) they probably don't care about, which means you can't make an apples-to-apples comparison of the scores. If this is counter-intuitive to you, consider that a polling question like ""Are you satisfied with your knowledge of Japanese?"" would result in near-perfect satisfaction scores for those in the general public who have no interest in Japanese (knowledge and desire are matched near zero), but lower scores in students of the Japanese language. Even the best student will probably never reach the 5/5 satisfaction-due-to-apathy of the non-student.  
   
I am frustrated by the authors' decision not to be candid about the negative male-to-female results in the abstract, which is all most people (including news reporters) will be able to read. I have seen gender distressed teenagers with their parents in the psychiatric ER, and many of them are high functioning enough to read and be aware of these studies. While some teens want to transition for personal reasons, regardless of the outcomes data, in much the same way that an Orthodox Jew might want to be circumcised regardless of health benefits, others are in distress and are looking for an evidence-based answer. In the spring of 2023, I had a male-to-female teen in my ER for suicidal ideation, and patient and mother both expressed hopefulness about recently started hormonal treatment, citing news coverage of the paper. This teen had complicated concerns about gender identity, but was explicitly starting hormones to treat depression, and it is unclear whether they would have wanted such treatment without news reporting on Chen 2023.  
   
Moving on to the general results, the authors quantify mental health outcomes as: ""positive affect \[had an\] annual increase on a 100-point scale \[of\] 0.80 points...life satisfaction \[had an\] annual increase on a 100-point scale \[of\] 2.32 points...We observed decreased scores for depression \[with an\] annual change on a 63-point scale \[of\] −1.27 points...and decreased \[anxiety scores\] annual change on a 100-point scale \[of\] −1.46 points...over a period of 2 years of GAH treatment."" These appear to be small effects, but interpreting quantitative results on mental health scales can be tricky, so I will not say that these results are necessarily too small to be clinically meaningful, but because there is no control group these results are small enough to raise concerns about whether GAH outperforms placebo. It is unfortunate that it is not always straightforward to compare depression treatments due to several scales being in common use, but we can see the power of the placebo effect in other clinical trials on depression. In the original clinical trials for Trintellix, a scale called MADRS was used for depression, which is scored out of 60 points, and most enrolled patients had an average depression score from 31-34. Placebo reduced this score by 10.8 to 14.5 points within 8 weeks (see Table 4, page 21 of FDA label). For Auvelity, another newer antidepressant, the placebo group's depression on the same scale fell from 33.2 to 21.1 after 6 weeks (see Figure 3 of page 21 of FDA label).  
   
I won't belabor the point, but anyone familiar with psychiatric research will be aware that placebo effects can be very large, and they occur across multiple diagnoses, including surprising ones like schizophrenia (see Figure 3 of the FDA label for Caplyta). I am genuinely surprised and confused by how minimal this cohort's response to treatment was. Early in my career I thought we were trading the risk of transition regret for great short-term benefit, and I was confused when I noticed how patients given GAH didn't seem to get better. This data confirms my experience is not a fluke. I could go in depth about their anxiety results, which on a hundred-point scale fell by less than 3 points after two years, but this would read nearly identically to the paragraph above.  
   
A more formal analysis of this paper might try to estimate the effects of psychotherapy and subtract them away from the reported benefits of GAH, and an even more sophisticated analysis might try to tease apart the benefits of testosterone for gender dysphoria per se from its more general impact on mood, but I think this is unnecessary given the very small effects reported and the placebo concerns documented above. Putting biological girls on testosterone is conceptually similar to giving men anabolic steroids, and I remain genuinely surprised that it wasn't more beneficial for their mood in the short term. Some men on high doses of male steroids are euphoric to the point of mania.  
   
But my biggest concerns with this paper are in the protocol. This paper was part of TYCUS, the Trans Youth Care in United States study, and the attached protocol document, containing original (2016) and revised (2021) versions explains that acute suicidality was an exclusion criterion for this study (see section 4.6.4). There were two deaths by suicide in this study, and 11 reports of suicidal ideation, out of 315 participants, and these patients showed no evidence of being suicidal when the study began. This raises the possibility of iatrogenic harm. It would be beneficial to have more data on the suicidality of this cohort, but the next problem is that the authors did not report this data, despite collecting it according to their protocol document.  
   
The 5 reported outcome measures in Chen 2023 are only a small fraction of the original data collected. The authors also assessed suicidality, Gender Dysphoria per se (not merely appearance congruence), body esteem and body image (two separate scales), service utilization, resiliency and other measures. This data is missing from the paper. I do not fully understand why the NEJM allowed such a selective reporting of the data, especially regarding the adverse suicide events. A Suicidal Ideation Scale with 8 questions was administered according to both the original and revised protocol. In a political climate where these kinds of treatments are increasingly viewed with hostility and new regulatory burdens, why would authors, who often make media appearances on this topic, hide positive results? It seems far more plausible that they are hiding evidence of harm.  
   
Of course, Chen 2023 is not the only paper ever published on gender medicine, but aside from Tordoff 2022 it is nearly the only paper in modern teens to attempt to measure mental health outcomes. The Ascha 2022 paper on chest masculinization surgery I mentioned above uses as its primary outcome a rating scale called the Chest Dysphoria Measure (CDM), a scale that almost any person without breasts would have a low score on (with the possible exception of the rare woman who specifically wants to have prominent and large breasts that others will notice and comment on in non-sexual contexts), even if they experienced no mental health benefits from the breast removal surgery and regretted it. Only the first item (""I like looking at my chest in the mirror"") measures personal satisfaction. Other items, such as ""Physical intimacy/sexual activity is difficult because of my chest"" may be able to detect harm in a patient who strongly regrets the surgery but is worded in such a way as not to detect actual benefit. They should have left it at ""Physical intimacy/sexual activity is difficult"" because a person without breasts can't experience dysphoria or functional impairment as a result of having breasts, even if their overall functionality and gender dysphoria are unchanged. Gender dysphoria that is focused on breasts may simply move to hips or waist after the breasts are removed.  
   
Tordoff 2022 was an observational cohort study of 104 teens, with 7 on some kind of hormonal treatment for gender dysphoria at the beginning of the study and 69 being on such treatment by the end. The authors measured depression on the PHQ-9 scale at 3, 6, and 12 months, and reported ""60% lower odds of depression and 73% lower odds of suicidality among youths who had initiated PBs or GAHs compared with youths who had not."" This paper is widely cited as evidence for GAH, but the problem is that the treatment group did not actually improve. The authors are making a statistical argument that relies on the ""no treatment"" group getting worse. This would be bad enough by itself, but the deeper problem is that the apparent worsening of the non-GAH group can be explained by dropout effects. There were 35 teens not on GAH at the end of the study, but only 7 completed the final depression scale.  
   
The data in eTable 3 of the supplement is helpful. At the beginning the 7 teens on GAH and the 93 not on GAH have similar scores: 57-59% meeting depression criteria and 43-45% positive for self-harming or suicidal thoughts. There is some evidence of a temporary benefit from GAH at 3 months, when the 43 GAH teens were at 56% and 28% for depression and suicidality respectively, and the 38 non-GAH teens at 76% and 58%. At 6 months the 59 GAH teens and 24 non-GAH teens are both around 56-58% and 42-46% for depression and suicidality. At 12 months there appears to be a stark worsening of the non-GAH group, with 86% meeting both depression and suicidality criteria. However, this is because 6/7 = 86% and there are only 7 subjects reporting data out of the 35 not on GAH from the original 104 subject cohort. The actual depression rate for the GAH group remains stable around 56% throughout the study, and the rate of suicidality actually worsens from Month 3 to Month 12.  
   
We cannot assume that the remaining 7 are representative of the entire untreated 35. I suspect teens dropped out of this study because their gender dysphoria improved in its natural course, as many adolescent symptoms, identities and other concerns do. However, even if you disagree with me on this point, the question you have to ask about the Tordoff study is why these 7 teens would go to a gender clinic for a year and not receive GAH. Whatever the reason was, it makes them non-representative of gender dysphoric teens at a gender clinic.  
   
The short-term effect of GAH is no longer an unanswered question. Its theoretical basis was strong in the absence of data, but like many strong theories it has failed in the face of data. Now that two studies have failed to report meaningful benefit we can no longer say, as we could as recently as 2021, that the short-term benefits are so strong that they outweigh the potential long-term risks inherent in permanent body modification. Some non-trivial number of patients come to regret these body modifications, and we can no longer claim in good faith that there are enormous short term benefits that outweigh this risk. The gender affirming clinicians had two bites at the apple to find the benefit that they claimed would justify these dramatic interventions, and their failure to find it is much greater than I could have imagined two years ago.  
   
I am not unaware of how fraught and politicized this topic has become, but the time has come to admit that we, even the moderates like me, were wrong. When a teenager is distressed by their gender or gendered traits, altering their body with hormones does not help their distress. I suspect, but cannot yet prove, that the gender affirming model is actively harmful, and this is why these gender studies do not have the same methodological problem of large placebo effect size that plagues so much research in psychiatry. When I do in depth chart reviews of suicidal twenty-something trans adults on my inpatient unit, I often see a pattern of a teenager who was uncomfortable with their body, ""affirmed"" in the belief that they were born in the wrong body (which is an idea that, whether right or wrong, is much harder to cope with than merely accepting that you are a masculine woman, or that you must learn to cope with disliking a specific aspect of your body), and their mental health gets worse and worse the more gender affirming treatments they receive. First, they are uncomfortable being traditionally feminine, then they feel ""fake"" after a social transition and masculine haircut, then they take testosterone and feel extremely depressed about ""being a man with breasts,"" then they have their breasts removed and feel suicidal about not having a penis. The belief that ""there is something wrong with my body"" is a cognitive distortion that has been affirmed instead of Socratically questioned with CBT, and the iatrogenic harm can be extreme.  
   
If we say we care about trans kids, that must mean caring about them enough to hold their treatments to the same standard of evidence we use for everything else. No one thinks that the way we ""care about Alzheimer's patients"" is allowing Biogen to have free rein marketing Aduhelm. The entire edifice of modern medical science is premised on the idea that we cannot assume we are helping people merely because we have good intentions and a good theory. If researchers from Harvard and UCSF could follow over 300 affirmed trans teens for 2 years, measure them with dozens of scales, and publish what they did, then the notion that GAH is helpful should be considered dubious until proven otherwise. Proving a negative is always tricky, but if half a dozen elite researchers scour my house looking for a cat and can't find one, then it is reasonable to conclude no cat exists. And it may no longer reasonable to consider the medicalization of vulnerable teenagers due to a theory that this cat might exist despite our best efforts to find it.

PS - To be clear, I support the civil rights of the trans community, even as I criticize their ideas. I see no more contradiction here than, for example, an atheist supporting religious freedom and being opposed to antisemitism. If an atheist can critique both the teachings and practices of hyper-Orthodox Hasidic Judaism, while being opposed to antisemitism at the same time, I believe that I can criticize the ideas of the trans community (""born in the wrong body"") while still supporting their civil rights and opposing transphobia in all forms.

averhoeven,"Thanks for this breakdown and analysis of the data. This might be the longest post I've ever read on Reddit. I think many have been skeptical of the increasing politicization of care that should be about the patients and not the ideology. And yet, in current circles as you've mentioned, it's become so politically taboo to even have the discussion or ask the question that a meaningful discussion cannot be had. I appreciate you being willing to put yourself out there to the mob per se and share an analysis of data which, frankly, most of us are never going to read or read that in depth because we have our own busy lives/practices. 
I'll be very interested to read any other educated perspectives on what you've said. As a pediatrician at my base, and one who often deals with significant teenage psychiatric comorbidities, I have a vested interest in the topic and a personal notion that something about how we currently perceive and treat all of this is flawed and potentially harmful. It's just unfortunate we often can't have that conversation without shouting from both extreme sides of the argument",Neutral,0.4402138590812683
,"Thank you for sharing your perspective. I'm also a psychiatrist (although not CAP) and I agree there are significant limitations in the current evidence base supporting medical interventions for gender dysphoria, especially in minors.

This is one of those ""emperor with no clothes"" scenarios. Any objective observer would note that there is a lack of high-quality, long-term data on outcomes. Most existing studies rely on small samples, short follow-up periods, convenience sampling, and high loss to follow-up. The few randomized trials have not demonstrated definitive mental health benefits from hormonal or surgical interventions. 

Often times, when this is brought up, the knee-jerk response is ""but WPATH guidelines are the standard of care."" Except WPATH guidelines are not grounded in robust evidence. And those who follow the organization know the changes that have happened in recent years. Former leaders being ousted because they've called for moderation and not jumping into blind affirmation without the evidence base to support that approach. The organization is not a neutral, professional scientific body and that major fact is often glossed over.

One of the most egregious examples of flimsy evidence guiding policy is the ""US Transgender Survey of 2015."" This has been cited about 3500 times in the literature and has informed every single US policy impacting transgender life. If you look at the original article, it's a complete joke. They used a grab sampling method. Basically an internet survey with no verification, asking people to invite others to fill out the survey. So a snowball sampling methods, a non-probability sampling method that you can not use to infer conclusions from a wider population. I've looked at the wording of some of the questions, some of the questions seemed almost designed to create demand bias (when the participants are aware of the researcher's aims and thus more likely to answer in a way that supports the investigator's goals). Not to mention, some of the findings are nonsensical. 73% of respondents said they started puberty blockers after the age of 18. Obviously, that's simply not true. 

To be blunt, psychiatry has a checkered history of too hastily adopting novel treatments without adequate study. Compassion for gender dysphoric individuals is important. Recommending irreversible medical interventions in vulnerable populations should require definitive, or at the very least probabilistic, proof of long-term benefit and minimal harm. Currently, that proof does not exist. Truly compassionate, ethical care means applying the same standards of evidence we expect in every other domain of medicine. We can't blindly embrace invasive, irreversible treatments in minors and sacrifice their wellbeing on the altar of ideological agendas or societal pressures.",Negative,0.6428949236869812

meansofproduction20,"Prefacing my comments with: I have performed and will continue to perform gender affirming surgeries to consenting trans adults, and I support protecting the civil rights and social acceptance of trans people.

From an Ob-Gyn perspective, it has always concerned me the lack of focus on whether or not minors can consent to medications that may severely limit or eliminate their reproductive options later in life. In any patient who I counsel regarding permanent forms of contraception, it is always a very careful process. Additionally, even just for a salpingectomy (where actually patients technically still have the ability to get IVF, so their fertility options are not completely eliminated) Medicaid requires special consent forms signed 30 days before we can even do the surgery, after which time we only have a 6 month window. This is a protective measure to prevent patient coercion.

So as giving puberty blockers and then cross sex hormones which prevent sexual maturity is a decision that I am not sure a preadolescent has the ability to consent to, from a reproductive standpoint. I understand these are all risk/benefit decisions with parents, patients, and doctors, and I don’t want to minimize the importance of privacy when making medical decisions.

But at the same time, historically the field of Ob/Gyn has had to reckon with the ethical and societal consequences of giving permanent contraception to patients who either did not consent or could not give appropriate consent. And I hope appropriate guardrails are in place to prevent adolescent psychiatry, and associated fields involved in gender affirming care for minors, from eliminating/limiting fertility options in trans teens and kids, without appropriate consent.

SereneTranscription,"Psychiatrist pitching in, copying over a comment from /r/Psychiatry.

I do not see patients who are outright MtF or FtM in my outpatient practice very often, and when I do it is not for their gender issues specifically, but I do see many young people these days who are gender non-conforming in some way. I have several patients who go by ""she/they"" pronouns who are entirely unable to articulate why they prefer this to ""she/her"" apart from some extremely vague discomfort with entirely feminine pronouns. I am of course happy to accommodate whatever pronouns they like but it does make me wonder how much of this is social contagion combined with a generalised ""feeling uncomfortable in your own body"" which is entirely normal for those of a certain age group or with certain other (non-gender dysphoria) mental health concerns which would simply self-terminate if not labelled and reinforced.

At the same time, I somewhat frequently see gender dysphoria as part of a package deal with BPD in crisis (as in not present outside of crises) in my inpatient practice. My approach is often to call them whatever they want to be called, and refer to an outpatient gender clinic - but I wonder how much iatrogenic harm could be caused by a clinician with a different approach.

Delicious-Resident-1,"In the spring of 2017 I had just finished an intensive clinical masters program (as a parent in my mid-30s with two young children) and was 8 months into my first job as a licensed professional. I had been skirting burnout during the last few months of my program, and learning a new profession was difficult and stressful, but exciting. Then I started experiencing severe fatigue and a general feeling of being really unwell. It felt like a flu that didn't go away for weeks. I was told it was likely just a viral illness that was hanging on, and to wait it out.

I had been off work for almost a month. Then my legs started feeling weak. I was tripping, had trouble going up and down stairs, etc. Then my arms. I was also having numbness/pins and needles in my hands, feet, and face. When I had to call my spouse to help me out of the bath and I found I couldn't lift my 3-lb kitten, I went to the emergency room. My neuro exam seemed ok. I had pretty severe muscle fatigue, but my reflexes were normal. They did a lumbar puncture, which came back normal. All my labs were normal. But there was enough concern that they admitted me with suspected Guillain-Barre Syndrome. They were also looking at other possibilities like Myasthenia Gravis. That evening, I began coughing when eating and was made NPO. They did a full brain and spine MRI, which was normal. They did an EMG, which apparently confirmed the GB dx and started me on IVIg.   
  
The third day at the hospital was the worst. I couldn't hold a phone to my ear. I was able to walk to the bathroom with a walker and a nurse supporting me, but that was a stretch. I had been on the phone briefing the colleague who was covering for me, and the longer I talked, the more numb my face and hands got. Once I hung up, I felt like I couldn't get enough oxygen. I ended up having an acute episode of hypocalcemia, causing tetany with carpal spasm. My whole body was immobile and numb, and my hands were frozen into claws for maybe 20 minutes to an hour. Later they told me that anxiety had caused me to hyperventilate, leading to this episode, but I don't remember feeling anxious at all until I couldn't breathe. I knew that many people with GB end up on a vent, so I think it's reasonable that feeling unable to breathe might make me anxious. Annoyingly, they called in psych and diagnosed me with anxiety, which I still think is pretty ridiculous.

After 5 days of IVIg, I was significantly better and was discharged. My neurologist said I should be totally back to normal within 6 weeks with PT and OT, and the good thing about GB was that it was a one-off disease and they had caught it before it had done permanent damage. She foresaw no long-term effects.  
  
I was back to normal within a month, went back to work half-time during July and full-time in  August. Around mid-September the fatigue returned, followed by the weakness and paresthesia. My neurologist denied my experience, saying it hadn't gotten worse and it was just part of recovery. Then one day I got out of bed and my legs collapsed under me. I was off work again. I got another EMG, which was normal. And the neuromuscular specialist who did it reviewed the first EMG in the hospital and questioned my original diagnosis. All my blood work was still normal. I was now in a situation where I was too ill to work, but everyone was telling me I should be fine. I also started having severe IBS symptoms for the first time in my life.

Over the next 6 months, my symptoms slowly improved, and by June of the following year, I was feeling well. During this time, we had started the process of moving from the US to Canada, to be closer to my spouse's family, and in the fall of 2018, we made that move. I began thinking about getting licensed in my profession in Canada and going back to work.

In the winter of 2019, I crashed again. The fatigue was severe again, but I did not have weakness. I had nausea/IBS again, paresthesias, and now significant pain in the joints of my hands, wrists, feet, and hips. I also had extremely dry eyes, so bad that a regular ophthalmologist referred me to a specialist. I saw a neurologist again. My neuro exam and blood work was normal. My family doctor tried to refer me to rheumatology, but they refused the referral because I did not have any blood markers. Again, after 6-8 months without treatment, I slowly got better.  
  
From late 2019 until the summer of 2024, I was well. If I started experiencing increased fatigue, I would slow down and rest more, and it would get better. Tingling in my hands and face were another warning sign, but would disappear with rest. We made another move to a different province, I became registered in my profession again, and I slowly, cautiously, began working again part-time.   
  
In 2022, I was diagnosed with autism and ADHD. I came to the realization that throughout my life, neuro-cognitive burnout would lead to physical illness. As a child, even though I loved school and was very social, I knew I needed more rest and more breaks from social interaction than most people. I faked being sick a lot because my parents didn't understand. When I was around 12 I had an extended period of unexplained severe headaches. I had pneumonia a handful of times. I missed a ton of school in 12th grade, when I turned 18 and could excuse myself. In college, I had an extended period of severe fatigue that forced me to withdraw one semester. It was attributed to anemia, but I had been trying to work full-time and take a full-time course load, which, of course, led to burnout.

ADHD meds were a game changer for me. Without them, there is no way I would've been able to go back to work at all. In 2023, after a year of working part-time in a job that was easy and non-clinical (and paid peanuts) while taking private clients on the side, I decided to take a clinical job. It was part-time, but at the same time I started getting more referrals for my own private clients, so since last January, I've essentially been working full-time: half in a clinic and half travelling around to community sites. I am considered a specialist in my field and am the only person in my area doing the specific work that I do.

This job may not seem too grueling, but everyone in my household is AuDHD. My spouse (bless him) has worked full-time the whole 20 years we've been together, but this means he's always overwhelmed and does not have the capacity to do much else. My oldest just finished high-school. He has severe OCD, has experienced horrible trauma in schools that don't understand and can't support him, and finished the last of his work from home. I had to basically drag him, limping, across the finish line. My youngest is in middle school and for the past 3 years has quit attending school around March, when she hits her limit. So the spring was overwhelming and stressful.

We moved 1500km away from any family to a place where we hoped to buy a house. In the year it took me to become registered in my profession, the average home price in this city (which we moved to because it was still affordable) jumped from $350k to $550k, and interest rates to over 7%. Even if I had been able to sustain full-time work, that prices us out of the market. We are stuck in a rental house that we are incredibly lucky to have, because rental prices have also soared and there is 100% occupancy in this city and families living in tents. Even though our rent is under market, it's still more than we can afford, and our savings, which was supposed to be our down payment, is shrinking. Still, we're lucky to have a place to live and savings at all.

In June of this year, I started experiencing severe fatigue. My ADHD meds stopped working, suddenly and completely. Then the weakness in my arms and legs returned. It felt exactly like the first episode in 2017. I immediately took 2 weeks off of work and stopped doing anything, hoping that complete rest would head this off. I didn't get better. My eyes got dry again, I started having pain in my thumb and big toe joints and my knees. My head started feeling really heavy. My vision was getting blurry, more sensitive to light, and it was harder to focus my eyes. Then my voice would get rough when I was really tired and I started coughing a lot first thing in the morning and when I ate or drank. 

Thinking I might be aspirating, I went to the emergency room. Based on my history and presenting symptoms, they suspected myasthenia gravis. They did a neuro exam, blood work, chest x-ray and CT. After neuro saw me, they were fairly confident it was MG and laid out a treatment plan with a trial of Mestinon. A modified barium swallow study showed that I was not aspirating, but I was having significant silent reflux, which explained my coughing and rough voice. I got in for an EMG quickly, and they did an extensive repetitive muscle stimulation test. It was normal. The neuro team completely back-tracked, ordered rheumatological blood work, and referred me back to my family doctor. When I asked what the plan was, 5 doctors stood there and stared at me. The neuro attending said something about fibromyalgia, which made me want to throw something at her. When I brought up the fact that I am too ill to work and asked what kind of doctor sees patients like me after neuro clears them, she mumbled something about rheumatology, knowing full well that I will never meet the requirements for a rheumatology referral in this province (or many others). They discharged me with a prescription for reflux medication.

I saw my family doctor 2 weeks later, and all she did was recommend PT and CBT. When I said that IVIg worked for me before, and could that be justification for trying it again, she said there's no way it would be approved. She said that autoimmune diseases ""virtually always"" show up in labs, which I know is complete bullshit.

I am sad, and frustrated, and not sure what to do now. I have a bunch of unfinished paperwork, which makes me look unprofessional, but I don't have the focus or cognitive stamina to get through it. My aunt wants me to fly to the US to see my uncle's naturopath, and I was referred to a naturopath here as well, but I don't feel safe going to either. The one in the US sounds like a charlatan, from what I know. And the one here (recommended by my son's therapist, who I have so much trust in) I found out is a DAN (Defeat Autism Now) ""doctor,"" which screams red flags all over. And I've fallen into the rabbit hole of alternative medicine before, which is not emotionally or psychologically healthy for me. I have bordered on orthorexia in the past. These things become all-consuming for me.

Flaky_Revenue_3957,"I started experiencing strange symptoms 3 years ago. All of my symptoms seemed unrelated to my family doctor and I have had all the referrals - urology, pain clinic, psychology, neurology, physical therapy, neuromuscular specialist, etc. Finally, about 6 months ago I was diagnosed with Myasthenias Gravis (MG) based on two physical exams and a positive ACHR blood test. My EMG on my eye was negative but I have struggled with the stereotypical eye droop/double vision. On the day I had the EMG, I was feeling pretty good. I was finally diagnosed my a neuromuscular specialist with MG (mild, general). 

I trialed Mestinon for 3 months (60mg / 3x day)and provided zero reprieve, except undesirable side effects (GI). I have often wondered if I have another autoimmune disease because there are so many things not explained by my MG diagnosis: frequent low grade fevers and the worst symptom: muscle pain. I’m at about a 6/10 pain level every day. During a flareup my pain is around a 8-9. This is coming from someone who has broken many bones (accident years ago) and really knows what 10 pain feels like. My family doctor sent me for a bunch of tests related to autoimmune diseases (like ANA) but apparently my blood look looks perfect (other than ACHR) and my doctor has suggested I don’t “go fishing” for more autoimmune diseases. 

I am not getting the medical treatment that I need. I have been brushed off by my neuromuscular specialist as being lucky to be a mild case and am only eligible for treatment (with my insurance) if my mobility gets so bad I need a wheelchair or breathing so bad that I need a breathing tube. My specialist says he won’t prescribe Prednisone unless my symptoms worsen and honest, after all the horror stories I have heard, I would be hesitant to go on it. I have 2 young kids. I do not want this to get worse. “Mild MG” is still having a huge impact on my life. I can’t imagine what those of you with more severe cases are going through. 

This is where I am looking for advice…I have some saving stashed away and would be more than willing to spend it on a thorough assessment and treatment. A clinic in North America would be most desirable but I would literally travel across the world if it meant getting the best help. I’ve been listening to Dr. Mark Hymans podcast (UltraWellness Center) and have heard a lot about the Mayo Clinic as being the gold standard for a thorough assessment and up-to-date treatment.

Psychiatrist says there is nothing they can do beyond the current medication and it sounds physiological. I had the same fight with my primary care over thyroid treatment that I had to enter a clinical trial to prove was right. I’m beside myself and honestly hate feeling this way and having my care providers just keep telling me there’s nothing wrong. I should not regularly turn pink and start sweating and shaking. Any advice is appreciated. I’m not looking for a solution, just a suggestion on how to start a healing process.",Negative,0.9303194880485535
nmarie1996,"So can I ask what makes you think there is an autoimmune issue going on? Have you had any lab work done at all? To ""start a healing process"" you need to know what's going on first. These symptoms alone could be any number of things and might not even be related to one another. So to start what you need to do is bring up these symptoms to a PCP and have them do a workup.

Did they actually straight out refuse testing because you have a mental health diagnosis, or did they explain how these symptoms are more likely due to an existing condition, side effect of a medication, etc? If it's the former, get a new doctor. That's really your only option. The thing is, these are common anxiety symptoms too. That's not to say if one has these symptoms it's anxiety and nothing else can be wrong. But if someone has anxiety *and* you rule out other potential causes, it's an understandable next thought. I say this too as someone with anxiety myself. I used to have serious flushing all over my body and convinced it was something other than anxiety until I found a medication that fixed the problem. Again, not to say that this is the case for you. 

But ultimately what you need is to confirm what labs are normal/abnormal before you can move forward. So many things can cause these symptoms - something like low blood sugar can cause sweating/shaking, for one example. If you're seeing an endo for thyroid stuff, it might be worth mentioning to them as these symptoms can sometimes correlate with hormonal issues. Overactive thyroid is another possibility if the labs suggest it.",Negative,0.5277218818664551

The pharmaceutical company AiCuris has asked us to connect to possible candidates for their clinical trial.

They are running a **Phase III trial on the efficacy and safety of Pritelivir, a viral enzyme inhibitor for Herpes Simplex Infections**.

In previous trials Pritelivir has shown higher efficacy than the approved medications Acyclovir and Valacyclovir, and it is effective also against strains that are resistant to the available medications.

The clinical trial is restricted to patients that have a higher need for a better medication; in particular to patients that suffer from an immunocompromised condition.

The **clinical trial of Pritelivir** accepts people that:

\- **have a HSV infection that is susceptible to acyclovir** (= it can be treated with acyclovir) or resistant to acyclovir

\- **are immunocompromised**. This definition includes many health conditions:

\-- diagnosed with **HIV** (a positive diagnosis is enough)

\-- or: diagnosed with an **autoimmune condition** (lupus, and many others) that require the use of immunosuppressant drugs

\-- or: diagnosed with **cancer**

&#x200B;

These people might suffer from the most severe outcomes when infected with Herpes Simplex. Therefore if you can, please bring this information to patients / clinics / advocacy groups that might benefit from it.

&#x200B;

More informations are available on the website of the clinical trial:

[https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03073967](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03073967) (part E)

and the possibility to take part to the clinical trial can be verified here:

At  the moment the clinical trial has study centers only in the US, but  they are going to open new centers across many countries in Europe and in China.

hereamiwhere,"So I’ve been recently diagnosed with undifferentiated connective tissue disease based on a positive ANA at 1:160 with all three homogenous, clumpy and punctuate nucleolar patterns (who even has that??) and low C3 and total complement levels, along with a myriad of symptoms that started 9 years ago after being massively overmedicated for migraines. 

I’ve been given plaquenil, but I must admit I’m a bit scared of the potential retinal toxicity. Is there any measure one could take to limit their chances of developing it? I immediately thought of lutein + zeaxanthin and wondered if they would be beneficial or actually detrimental. There’s virtually nothing about it throughout the internet, [this] (https://books.google.com.br/books?id=C3ceBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA2&lpg=PA2&dq=hydroxychloroquine+zeaxanthin+lutein&source=bl&ots=VNTx58PtTv&sig=ACfU3U0SU7JBiEB6IDSXvoXK44DgSjmFuw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjusrS7i57yAhUbpJUCHWKVC4gQ6AF6BAgNEAI) is really the best I could find. Unfortunately, as a science curious laywoman, I am having a bit of trouble understanding it:

*(Note: 4AQR = hydroxy-/chloroquine retinopathy)*

>Zeaxanthin is the predominant xanthophyll in the center of the macula with lutein rising in relative concentration in the parafovea [7]. The xanthophylls reduce chromatic aberration, absorb damaging blue light, and protect retinal membranes from photooxidation [7, 9]. **The extent of their distribution is similar to the size of the bull’s-eye macular lesion in 4AQR and suggests that they may have a role in toxicity.** 

Meaning here is that they should be detrimental, right? I don’t understand what “role in toxicity” they’re implying xanthophylls have. But then they go on to state:

>For example, 4AQR in its advanced stages manifests outer retinal atrophy that **spares the fovea** and is greatest from 2 to 8° eccentric to the fovea [10, 11]. **Xanthophylls have their greatest concentrations in the fovea and drop to a lower plateau within 4° of the fovea [9].**

Is this implying that zeaxanthin/xanthophylls could protect the fovea from plaquenil-induced damage or facilitate it? I don’t get what they’re trying to say here, the remarks seem to contradict one another. I’ve read that plaquenil has high affinity to melanin and binds to it in the retinal pigment epithelium, bioaccumulating and inducing damage. But could it do the same to macular pigments such as lutein and zeaxanthin?? Can the smarter people out there please chime in? 

Also, [another] (https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/21/14/4994/pdf ) thing I’ve found, this time regarding zinc, but am not sure if a potential benefit of zinc supplementation could be assumed from it:

>*6. Zinc and Autophagy in AMD

>Zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP) is a zinc compound present in trace amounts in red blood cells during heme synthesis (reviewed in [96]). In normal conditions, iron chelates with protoporphyrin, but in iron deficiency or impaired iron metabolism, zinc takes the role of iron, resulting in increased formation of ZPP. We and others have shown that compromised iron metabolism might play a role in AMD pathogenesis [97,98]. Therefore, ZPP may be an element of the involvement of zinc in AMD pathophysiology. Chloroquinone (CQ), a 4-aminoquinoline compound, is commonly used as an antimalarial and anti-inflammatory drug (reviewed in [99]). Although its mechanism of action as a pharmaceutical is not completely known, some of its biological effects may be underlined by inhibition of lysosome functions, which are critical for autophagy [100]. In particular, CQ can inhibit acidification of the lysosome, which is essential for its ability to transport and degrade the cargo via autophagy.

One last question for those in the know: would this be a drug whose metabolism would be considerably different among men and women and whose clinical trials would have been affected by gender bias? Any reason to believe it would be wise to prescribe lower doses for women?

soul-nova,"i know this is a very old post but i just want to comment in case anyone else comes upon it searching for information in the future, as I haven't seen much else on here about this. 

The way plaquenil damages the retina is by accumulating over time. the molecule adheres to the retina and gets stuck. When enough of it accumulates over time, it begins to affect vision. One scary thing is because of the very long half life of plaquenil, vision changes can continue worsening even after you stop the drug. The dose toxicity happens at is dependent on weight; for myself, it happened right when it was expected to, which was approximately thirteen years on an average dose of 200mg. The good news is if you get a visual field test every six months, you should catch it before it's too bad. For me, I do notice changes in vision but I'm mostly ok. It's annoying, but I'm nowhere near legally blind. But you are essentially putting your eyes on an ageing fast track.
